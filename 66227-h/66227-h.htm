<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I.</span>
<br />AN ALTERCATION.</h2>
<p>Mid-afternoon of an oppressively hot and sultry day, in
the year &rsquo;54.</p>
<p>We call the reader&rsquo;s attention to a scene, that, if not
romantic, is at least attractive and interesting; a wagon-train
of emigrants, as is attested by the quantity of driven stock&mdash;horses,
cattle and sheep. The presence of women and
children is still further evidence.</p>
<p>It moved slowly and drearily along over the vast, almost
barren stretch of level plain, as though the nearly spent day
had been one of hard and unremitting toil. The horses or
mules, their heads hanging down, with drooping ears and
tails, their hides damp with sweat and covered with the fine
sand cast upon the air by the trampling hoofs, or the slowly
revolving wheels, scarcely heed the stinging lash or the
impatient exclamation of their drivers.</p>
<p>The loose stock move dejectedly along, cured of their morning
propensity of running from the trail to snatch a mouthful
of grass, or nip the tops of a bush, while more than one
of the boys, whose duty it is to keep them within proper
limits, dozes in their hard saddles.</p>
<p>But there are three persons who appear full of life and free
from the general weariness of mind and body. There: one of
them a woman&mdash;a girl; the others men.</p>
<p>The first, who rode at several hundred yards in advance,
if closely scrutinized, proves to be an old man, who has numbered
his half-century, or perhaps nearly a decade more.
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
A close scrutiny, we say, for his figure was as erect and
vigorous, his motions as free and supple, the fire of his keen
gray eye as clear and penetrating as a generation since.</p>
<p>His hair and long flowing beard were gray, although the
thickly clinging dust effectually disguised this. From his
position, his arms, his actions, it was plain he acted as guide
to the wagon-train.</p>
<p>The next figure, about half-way between this man and the
foremost wagon, was also a man, and merits a brief description
at our hands for more than one reason.</p>
<p>In stature he was about the mean hight, of a rather slight
figure, but with a muscular and active development, clothed
in a plain and well-worn suit of gray. His dusky, olive complexion,
black hair and eyes like a sloe, had given him the
sobriquet of &ldquo;Dusky Dick,&rdquo; a name that was already famous
throughout the West.</p>
<p>Although not much, if any beyond his third decade, Richard
Rouzee, or &ldquo;Dusky Dick,&rdquo; had followed the calling of a guide
for a number of years, and gained the repute of being peculiarly
unfortunate, having lost one-half the trains he had acted
as pilot for, and rarely escaped without at least one fierce and
desperate struggle.</p>
<p>More than one dark rumor had been put in circulation,
and some more boldly declared that he was in league with
the red-skins, and only acted as guide, the more surely to
compass his purpose. But this was only conjecture, and
could not be substantiated by any valid proof.</p>
<p>The third person, who rode at some little distance to the
right, so as to escape the annoying dust, was a young woman
of more than common grace and beauty, although the latter
quality was somewhat obscured by the long, weary day&rsquo;s travel.</p>
<p>Rather above the medium hight, of a superbly rounded and
developed form, that was admirably displayed by her neatly-fitting
riding-habit of black, she sat her horse with the ease
and grace of an accomplished <i>equestrienne</i>, although he chafed
and fretted at the restraint of a tightly-drawn rein, caracoling
and prancing in proud strength and spirit.</p>
<p>It was a clear-cut profile and beautiful complexion that
Dusky Dick beheld from the corner of his dark, sinister eye,
that glared with a fire of unusual admiration. But this his
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
slouched hat concealed, and his smooth, beardless face gave
no outward sign of the dark and troubled thoughts that filled
his brain.</p>
<p>Then he pricked his half-wild mustang viciously with his
spur, and darted suddenly up beside the lady, who uttered a
half-suppressed exclamation of annoyance, and made no
attempt to conceal the expression of dislike and impatience
that clouded her usually sunny features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a wearisome day, Miss Clara,&rdquo; began the
guide, speaking in a low and remarkably musical voice
although his eyes flashed as he noticed her evident aversion.
&ldquo;But we are almost at the end of our day&rsquo;s journey. See&mdash;that
long dark line yonder, a little to the left, is our stopping-place,
beside a clear and beautiful stream. I know the
spot, well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we camp there? Well, I am glad of it, for more
than one reason,&rdquo; replied the lady, in an impatient tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to know the truth?&rdquo; asked Clara, with a
slight emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; the truth will be doubly pleasant, coming
from such winsome lips,&rdquo; Dusky Dick returned, with a half-mocking
bow and smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, the main reason is that once there, you will
have other things to attend to, and will not have so much
leisure to annoy others by impertinent and unwelcome attentions,&rdquo;
curtly replied Clara, urging her high-mettled horse
ahead, as if desirous of escaping the company of the swarthy
guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another reason is&mdash;that a certain baby-face, Buenos
Ayres by name, will not be long in feeding his horses, and
then, of course, will hasten to pay his respects to the belle of
the wagon-train,&rdquo; sneered Dusky Dick, keeping close to Clara,
whether she rode fast or slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rouzee,&rdquo; at length exclaimed Clara, her eyes flashing
angrily, and her cheeks flushing, &ldquo;your place as guide is yonder,
along with Tom Maxwell, and not out here. If I appear
rude, you force me to be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A guide&rsquo;s place depends greatly upon circumstances, Miss
Calhoun; and just now I prefer this position.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then occupy it alone; I will go back to the wagon,&rdquo; she
added, reining in her horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Miss Clara,&rdquo; cried Rouzee, his black eyes glittering.
&ldquo;Keep your place, but mark me, the time will come&mdash;and
soon too&mdash;when you will repent these haughty airs, and solicit
as a favor, what you now affect to scorn. I tell you that the
time is not far distant when you will crouch at my feet&mdash;when
you will hang around me for a word&mdash;a smile; when
you will call me <i>master</i>. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I tell you, sir, that when we camp to-night, you will
have to answer to the charge of being drunk while upon
duty,&rdquo; haughtily retorted Clara, her eyes flashing. &ldquo;Will you
go, sir, or must I appeal to my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide did not reply, but plunging his long, cruel spurs
into the flanks of his mustang, he dashed rapidly up alongside
of the old borderer, Tom Maxwell, who received him
with a cold, half-suspicious start. Evidently there was little
love lost between the two men.</p>
<p>Just before sunset, the long line of trees was reached, that
bordered upon a small stream, and preparations were immediately
begun for encamping, while Dusky Dick and Tom Maxwell
galloped off to hunt for &ldquo;sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mules and horses were ungeared and turned loose, after
being hoppled, and the wagons were formed into a rude sort
of corral, one line covering the joints in the other. All was
bustle and apparent confusion, although each person knew his
duty and busied himself about that alone.</p>
<p>Fires were built, and over them stooped the women, preparing
supper for the different messes; while the children
brought wood and water, or else rolled and tumbled over each
other with merry shouts, in their play, little recking what the
morrow might bring forth.</p>
<p>To one of these fires, a little apart from the remainder, we
now turn. Over it was bending the form of an old negro
woman, whose wrinkled features and gorgeous red and orange
head-gear, looked weird and wild through the flame-tinted
smoke.</p>
<p>A little to one side of this sat three persons, or rather half
reclining against the moss-covered roots of the gigantic oak
tree, idly watching the motions of &ldquo;Aunt Medora,&rdquo; as she
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
turned the hissing bacon, or the nicely browning &ldquo;hoe-cake.&rdquo;
One of these was Clara Calhoun; the others were men.</p>
<p>The eldest one&mdash;tall, portly and of a soldierly bearing&mdash;was
her father, the leader or captain of the wagon-train. Of
perhaps fifty years in age, his muscular frame gave no evidence
of decay, and the fire of youth still seemed to shine in
his large dark eyes. The heavy, grizzled mustache and
beard, gave a somewhat stern cast to his features, that were
massive and regular, and his voice, used to command, enhanced
this idea; but at heart he was kind and gentle.</p>
<p>The other was a young man, between his fifth and sixth
<i>lustrum</i>, with a handsome, manly face and form; with a
calm, steadfast look in his gray eye that instinctively commanded
one&rsquo;s respect, and told that he could be depended
upon in any emergency, however dangerous or trying.</p>
<p>His garments were plain and almost poor, but there was
an air of conscious independence and freedom in his bearing
and demeanor, that attracted one, despite himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, do you know that I think you made a great mistake
in hiring this Dusky Dick, or whatever may be his name,
to act as guide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so, Clara?&rdquo; asked her parent, with an air of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may laugh at me, or call me visionary, but I
shudder whenever he comes near me. I believe he is a traitor,
and that he has some deep purpose of his own that means
danger to us all. If you ask my reasons, I can only say what
I have; I only feel that he&rsquo;s not what he seems, and I shall
never rest easy until we are well rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him overly well, myself,&rdquo; slowly replied Calhoun,
&ldquo;but still, I think he is honest and trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why does he not attend to his business, instead of
intruding where he can&rsquo;t help but see his presence is unwelcome?&rdquo;
warmly cried Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, daughter, what do you mean? What has he been
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this. I can&rsquo;t stir a step from the wagons, but what
he is at my side, with his disagreeable smile and worse compliments.
At first I did not appear to mind them, but of late
he has grown still more impudent, and the worse I rebuff him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the more he persists, until now, unless it is put a stop to, I
will feel obliged to keep within the wagon all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never spoke of this before, Clara,&rdquo; uttered Calhoun,
slowly. &ldquo;If he has troubled you so much, why not have told
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I thought he would desist, and then there would
be no trouble. But to-day he grossly insulted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Buenos,&rdquo; commanded the major, placing a hand
upon the young man&rsquo;s arm, as he made a motion of anger&mdash;&ldquo;let
me settle this. He insulted you, Clara?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He told me that the time was not far distant when
I would crouch at his feet, and be glad to call him <i>master</i>!&rdquo;
exclaimed the maiden, her eyes flashing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what led to this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly remember, but I told him he had other duties to
perform, that would become him better than forcing his company
upon those to whom it was unwelcome. I had tried to
leave him by riding faster, to one side, or by falling back;
but he kept close beside me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Calhoun arose and glanced around upon the animated
scene. The two guides had returned, and were awaiting
supper, meanwhile smoking their pipes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Maxwell, come here for a moment,&rdquo; called the leader,
and the tall guide sprung nimbly to his feet and approached
the group, doffing the dirty felt hat, with an almost
reverential bow to Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maxwell, my man, I wish to ask your advice, and I trust
you will be plain and candid, in your reply,&rdquo; began Calhoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maje, I&rsquo;m Tom Maxwell, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve hearn tell o&rsquo; me
afore now; but did you ever hear &rsquo;at I lied, or made a
prac<i>tyce</i> o&rsquo; any sech a dirty, sneakin&rsquo; business? The truth
is a mighty broad an plain trail, boss, to them which is clear
in the sight, an&rsquo; my ol&rsquo; mother l&rsquo;arnt me to squint true &rsquo;long
that trail, tellin&rsquo; me&mdash;&lsquo;Now, sonny, jest foller your nose, an&rsquo;
go ahead!&rsquo; An&rsquo; ever sence then, I&rsquo;ve did so, on&rsquo;y, mayhap,
steppin&rsquo; a lettle to one side in the matter o&rsquo; a red-skin, or
sech like; but I al&rsquo;ays tuck it up jest whar I left it. I&rsquo;ll tell
you the truth ef it bu&rsquo;sts me&mdash;go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calhoun appeared used to the somewhat rambling style of
the old guide, and resumed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were just talking about this Dusky Dick, as you call
him; what is your opinion of him, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-u-m! As a guide, or a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya&mdash;as,&rdquo; drawled Maxwell, smoking rapidly. &ldquo;Fust, as
a guide. He&rsquo;s quick an&rsquo; sharp-witted, knows a buffler-chip
from a ant-hill; he is dead shore on a trail or fer sign; a
bully shot, rider, an&rsquo; all that; kin tell you, or mark down
like a printed map, every river, crick an&rsquo; waterhole that is
atween here an&rsquo; Salt Lake. Or to sum it up, as the lawyers
o&rsquo; St. Louey &rsquo;d say, he knows every feet o&rsquo; the trail, kin tell
whar to ixpect Injuns, or not to ixpect &rsquo;em, ekil to anybody
what lives an&rsquo; breathes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You praise him up very highly, Tom,&rdquo; remarked Buenos
Ayres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I, then? That&rsquo;s jest as folks thinks. But honest,
I don&rsquo;t know a single man &rsquo;at I&rsquo;d ruther hev along &rsquo;th me,
&rsquo;n this very Dusky Dick, <i>pervidin&rsquo;</i>, mind ye, thet he hed
some strong intrust in the train&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; through right side up,
all hunky. But ef so be he hed a spite ag&rsquo;inst anybody, then
I&rsquo;d ruther hev the devil hisself fer a chum,&rdquo; he said, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as a man,&rdquo; added Major Calhoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, fust; he shoots off his mouth too durned much;
he&rsquo;d talk the ha&rsquo;r off &rsquo;m a buffler bull&rsquo;s hump, an&rsquo; not more&rsquo;n
hafe try. He&rsquo;s wuss &rsquo;n old Daddy Lapyear, the preacherman
which used to keep camp meetin&rsquo; nigh to whar I lived
when a little shaver; an&rsquo; more&rsquo;n that couldn&rsquo;t be said.
Look at his eyes&mdash;look at his face&mdash;look at his motion; look
at him all over, well. The hull outfit sais <i>snake</i>, jest as plain
as geese-goose; an&rsquo; the wust kind o&rsquo; sarpint, too&mdash;the ongainly,
sneakin&rsquo; copperhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef he tuck a dislike to a feller, would he come right out
flatfooted an&rsquo; tell him so? Nary time&mdash;not muchly! He&rsquo;d
lay low an&rsquo; bite &rsquo;em in the heel. He&rsquo;s pizon, I tell ye, pizon
from head to toe, an&rsquo; sartin death. Ef he gives you a black
look, jest putt your heel on his head an&rsquo; squash it. But look
to your boots, fust. Gi&rsquo; me a match, youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calhoun then repeat the threats of Dusky Dick, he had
that day addressed to Clara, and then awaited Tom&rsquo;s reply, in
some anxiety of mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he said <i>that</i>&mdash;<i>he</i> did?&rdquo; slowly returned Maxwell, his
brow knitting, as he puffed furiously at his relighted pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those words, or to the same effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal then, thar&rsquo;s snags ahead, boss, you kin jest bet your
high old ocean ware!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you goin&rsquo;
to do &rsquo;bout it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, just yet. That is what I asked your opinion
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal then, ef he said them words, he <i>meant</i> somethin&rsquo;.
He ain&rsquo;t the sort o&rsquo; feller to shoot his mouth off at nothin&rsquo;,
when he&rsquo;s mad, jest fer the fun o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo; hisself talk. Look
here&mdash;do you know &rsquo;at he&rsquo;s lost <i>four</i> trains in the last two
years? an&rsquo; that one more jest got through by stud-hoss luck,
a&rsquo;ter two days&rsquo; hard fightin&rsquo;? I don&rsquo;t say &rsquo;at he&rsquo;s in cahoot
&rsquo;th the reds, not a-tall; but ef I hed a spite ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; this &rsquo;ere
train, an&rsquo; wanted to git it wiped out, I&rsquo;d jest go to Mister
Dusky Dick, <i>Es</i>quire, an&rsquo; say&mdash;<i>whar&rsquo;s the brigynees, Dick?&rdquo;</i>
significantly replied Tom, tapping one horny finger against the
other palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you advise, Maxwell?&rdquo; somewhat anxiously
asked Major Calhoun, deeply impressed by the earnest
words of the veteran guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I &rsquo;vise? Now thar you&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> me, as Joe
Nerr said to the whale when he sucked him in. What <i>d&rsquo;you</i>
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought some of discharging him,&rdquo; was the thoughtful
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very wust thing you could do! &rsquo;Cause why. Ef
he <i>is</i> a runnygade, thet is jest what he&rsquo;d choose hisself, an&rsquo;
then he&rsquo;d hold high, low, jack in his hand, &rsquo;th a fa&rsquo;r show o&rsquo;
ketchin&rsquo; the game, to boot. No, sir! You must keep him,
an&rsquo; say nothin&rsquo; to make him &rsquo;spicious, an&rsquo; then&mdash;<i>watch &rsquo;im</i>.
You&rsquo;ll watch&mdash;the young feller, <i>he&rsquo;ll</i> watch, an&rsquo; <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> watch, an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s hard but what we kin manidge to keep him in trim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S&mdash;st!&rdquo; cautioned Ayres, rising erect, with hand upon his
ready revolver. &ldquo;So, Mr. Dusky Dick, this is a specimen of
your manners, is it? Eavesdropping!&rdquo; he added, as the form
of the guide stepped out from behind the tree beneath which
the party were sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should the <i>criminal</i> be absent when he is being tried?&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
sneered Rouzee, with a slight emphasis on the word italicized.
&ldquo;I was passing by&mdash;I heard my name coupled with treachery&mdash;and
so I paused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest so&mdash;I was hungry&mdash;I saw a fat goose&mdash;I stole it, said
the fox!&rdquo; murmured Tom, carelessly hitching his belt around.
&ldquo;I told you he was a snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you hear?&rdquo; demanded Calhoun, arising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard myself accused of treachery&mdash;of being a renegade,
and in collusion with the Indians. If not in so many words,
at least plainly enough to be understood,&rdquo; said Dusky Dick,
deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then&mdash;what is your answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be! You are dissatisfied with me, and condemn
me unheard. I will not serve any man who does not
trust me fully. Tom Maxwell, yonder, knows the route quite
as well as I do, and is capable of acting alone. I will bid
you good-by, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to leave us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you heard so much, Mr. Rouzee, as you say, surely you
heard Maxwell&rsquo;s last words?&rdquo; coldly added Major Calhoun.
&ldquo;We prefer not to part with you; at least, not until we have
reached a safer portion of the country than this is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True as preachin&rsquo;!&rdquo; softly interjected the old guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to detain me against my will?&rdquo; said Dusky
Dick, stepping back a pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If necessary&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By force, if you compel us to adopt harsh measures,&rdquo; impatiently
exclaimed the major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Mr. Calhoun,&rdquo; began Rouzee, in a firm
tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a free man, and not bound to you in any way.
I have honestly performed my part of the contract, thus far,
and if I choose to leave you now, all you can do is to retain
my wages. Do this if you will, but I&rsquo;ll not stay with you
any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef I hed a jass-ack what wouldn&rsquo;t go, d&rsquo;y&rsquo; think I&rsquo;d wallop
&rsquo;im?&mdash;bet your monkey-musek I <i>would</i>!&rdquo; gently whistled
Tom Maxwell, eying Dusky Dick with a benignant smile
from beneath his battered slouch hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are but one&mdash;we are three&mdash;or if but one word is
spoken aloud, fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am Dusky Dick!&rdquo; cried the guide, in a defiant tone.
&ldquo;You have heard of me before now, but you will <i>know</i> me, if
you persist in this outrage. I tell you that I <i>will</i> go, and
there is but one thing that can stop me&mdash;<i>death</i>!&rdquo; and as he
spoke, he leaped back so as to place the trio in front of him,
and drawing a brace of revolvers, he cocked them with a
clear, significant click.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That long-legged beauty yonder told you that I could
shoot true, and for once he told the truth. You may keep
me here, but it will not be while I can draw trigger or sight
along a barrel. Stop!&rdquo; he added, sternly, as the three men
made a motion toward advancing. &ldquo;The first weapon drawn,
or the first step toward me, will be the death-warrant of Miss
Clara yonder! Before God, I will shoot her, if I am molested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw that he was in terrible earnest, and instinctively
shrunk back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shell I take him, maje&mdash;shell I take him?&rdquo; hoarsely whispered
the old guide, his form crouching and trembling with
anger, at the rebel&rsquo;s audacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, don&rsquo;t stir, Tom&mdash;for your life, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Calhoun,
fearfully. &ldquo;The devil will shoot her if you do! Go,
then, if you wish it, but if you harm one of the party, I will
hunt you down like a dog! Go, while you can,&rdquo; he added,
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Dusky Dick, &ldquo;you are very generous,
Major Calhoun, and I congratulate you upon the facility with
which you reverse your decision. I <i>will</i> go, but you may expect
me again, very soon. I love Miss Clara too greatly to
abandon her so abruptly, for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him, father!&rdquo; cried Clara, as she sprung up behind
the huge tree-trunk. &ldquo;Never mind me&mdash;don&rsquo;t let him brave
you so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men abruptly turned around at this sudden interruption,
and then as they saw that the maiden&rsquo;s maneuver
placed her in comparative safety, they quickly drew their
weapons; but the guide had vanished, and his taunting laugh
of defiance echoed back through the woods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After him, Tom&mdash;Buenos! and shoot him like a wolf,
if you find him!&rdquo; shouted Calhoun, as the three men dashed
through the timber, in the direction from whence had come
the insolent laugh.</p>
<p>But their efforts at Dusky Dick&rsquo;s capture were all in vain,
although the majority of the now fully aroused campers set
out in pursuit of the fugitive; and one by one they returned
to their now cold supper, silent and filled with a dim foreboding
of impending peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad job, maje, a pesky bad job,&rdquo; quoth Tom Maxwell,
as he helped himself to a fresh supply of the rude but
wholesome viands; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m dub&rsquo;ous that it hain&rsquo;t all over
yit. He never shed &rsquo;a&rsquo; got away&mdash;never! But who under
the sun would &rsquo;a&rsquo; thunk he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; p&rsquo;inted them pistils at Miss
Clary? The dratted sarpint! Burnin&rsquo;s too good for sech
as <i>he</i> is! Lord&mdash;Lord! what&rsquo;s this world a-comin&rsquo; to, when
sech pesky critters is made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Double guards were posted that night, and an unusually
strict watch was kept, but the long night passed by without
further event worthy of record, and as the sun arose, it shined
down upon the party slowly trailing along their weary way.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />THE STORM-CLOUD BREAKS.</h2>
<p>The next day and the next passed by without any event
other than such usually attendant upon an emigrant&rsquo;s daily
toil along the almost endless trail, and the majority of the
party were inclined to laugh at the parting words of Dusky
Dick, as mere vaporings, proceeding from chagrin.</p>
<p>But not so with all. Tom Maxwell did not take this view
of it, nor did the major or Buenos Ayres, and a steady, unremitting
watch was kept up, both night and day, while great
precautions were used in selecting the nightly encampment.</p>
<p>Toward night of the second day succeeding the departure
of Rouzee, the veteran guide paused until the wagon driven
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
by young Ayres, in which also sat Major Calhoun, came up
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now, Max?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, maje, as I knows on,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;But
look yonder&mdash;d&rsquo; y&rsquo; see them &rsquo;ar trees, jest beyon&rsquo; that peint
o&rsquo; risin&rsquo; ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the place to camp to-night. Plenty of wood,
water an&rsquo; grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried the leader, seeing that something lay
beyond the guide&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, boss, but what you&rsquo;ll laugh at me, an&rsquo;
think I mought be in better biziness, but&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Tom,
a little nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I, Tom? I certainly should not if you are
in earnest. But what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest this: you hain&rsquo;t forgot what Dusky Dick said, nor
hain&rsquo;t I n&rsquo;ither. It&rsquo;s be&rsquo;n a-runnin in my mind all day, an&rsquo;
I can&rsquo;t help thinkin&rsquo; that thar&rsquo;s so&rsquo;thin&rsquo; in it. You know he
said that we&rsquo;d see him ag&rsquo;in, an&rsquo; his eyes said, jest as plain as a
nigger&rsquo;s heel, that if we did, it would not be <i>alone</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon; leastways I &rsquo;spect so. Ef you ax <i>what</i>, why
I&rsquo;ll bet a buffler&rsquo; hump ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; a turkey buzzard, that we&rsquo;ll
&rsquo;ither see or hear so&rsquo;thin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Mr. Dusky Dick, afore another
sun. I feel it all over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; somewhat impatiently asked
Major Calhoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to scout &rsquo;round ontel dusk. I know the lay
right well around here, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s jist the out-doin&rsquo;est place you
ever did see, for &rsquo;bushments and Injun deviltries. It&rsquo;s a
plain shoot for the river thar, an&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t need me for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be gone long, nor run any more risk than is
absolutely necessary, Maxwell,&rdquo; earnestly added Calhoun;
&ldquo;for you are our only dependence, now. I don&rsquo;t believe
there is one of us all that has the slightest idea of where we
are, or the road necessary to take, in order to reach safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maje,&rdquo; slowly said the old guide, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rough old
coon, what ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo; much a&rsquo;count one way nor t&rsquo;other; I
hain&rsquo;t got no kin, nor &rsquo;lations livin,&rsquo; as I knows on. I never
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
hed a wife&mdash;leastways, nobody &rsquo;cept it mought be a squaw,
now an&rsquo; then, for a week or so, an&rsquo; I never hed a child who
could call me pap; but for all that, I know how you must
feel when you look at Miss Clary, an&rsquo; think &rsquo;at she&rsquo;s in
danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo; much a&rsquo;count, as I said, for I&rsquo;m old an&rsquo; most
wored out, but still I&rsquo;d fou&rsquo;t as hard as the best, for the few
drops o&rsquo; blood in my karkidge, an&rsquo; I say sooner than let <i>her</i>
get hurt, even to her teentiest finger, why I&rsquo;d be shot, burnt,
cut to pieces an&rsquo; then swallered hole! I would, by ge-mently!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Tom, but I hope there&rsquo;ll be no call for
your doing all that,&rdquo; laughed Calhoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, jist follow your nose, an&rsquo; stop yonder ontil I git
back,&rdquo; and then loosening the tightly drawn rein against which
his half-wild mustang was chafing, the grizzled old guide sped
swiftly away from the wagon-train.</p>
<p>Once beyond sight of the trail, Maxwell proceeded more
slowly and with greater precaution. Veering to the right, so as
to embrace as much ground as possible in his contemplated
<i>detour</i>, he closely scrutinized the ground for sign, while
keeping a wary look-out upon either hand and in front, not
caring to run blindfold into an ambush should there in reality
prove to be enemies in his vicinity.</p>
<p>He was proceeding thus, when his horse suddenly gave a
snort and stood still in his track. Quickly raising his eyes
from the ground, the old guide sent a keen glance around
him, and then uttered a long, low whistle, as he perceived
the evident cause of his animal&rsquo;s alarm.</p>
<p>Just debouching from the hills, or rather from behind
them, was a large body of horsemen, and though at nearly a
mile&rsquo;s distance, he had no hesitation in pronouncing them to
be Indians, from the long spears and various trappings, together
with their peculiar style of riding. They were to the
right, and at the same time a little in his front, being nearly
in a direct line with himself and the place where the emigrants
intended to camp for the night.</p>
<p>They had evidently observed him, and had paused, as if in
irresolution, thus allowing Maxwell a moment for deliberation.</p>
<p>They might be friendly, but he did not believe it, and felt
little inclined to cultivate their close acquaintance. Still he
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
did not like to run, for he well knew the truth of the old
adage&mdash;a fleeing form invites pursuit&mdash;and that should he
flee, the rogues would assuredly chase him.</p>
<p>Then were they hostile, as he more than suspected, the
emigrants would undoubtedly be the sufferers, as they had not
yet had time to encamp and corral the wagons, in order of
defense. Outnumbered and taken by surprise, they would
be massacred without mercy.</p>
<p>Tom Maxwell did not believe that their exact position was
known by the Indians, from the unguarded movements of the
latter, and resolved to draw them away, if possible, or at least
detain them until the emigrants would be better prepared for
the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Ebenezer,&rdquo; he muttered, drawing up the reins and
settling himself firmly in the deep saddle; &ldquo;you hain&rsquo;t any
much tired as yit, an&rsquo; kin hold your own with these scalawags,
for a bit, anyhow. Now you jest git up an&rsquo; <i>git</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Maxwell urged the sturdy mustang onward,
uttering a wild yell and bending low down.</p>
<p>As if decided upon their course by the old man&rsquo;s action,
the Indians dashed after him, <i>in silence</i>. The look of anxiety
upon Maxwell&rsquo;s face deepened, as he noted this fact, for it
served to confirm his already strong suspicions.</p>
<p>He knew that only some great and powerful motive could
induce an Indian to suppress the vindictive, exultant yell
usual when their foe and an anticipated victim is before them;
and what could that motive be, unless it was a desire not to
alarm the company of emigrants whom he had been guiding?
More than ever he believed that Dusky Dick was connected
with this new phase, and if so, he would need to be doubly
wary and foresighted.</p>
<p>Instead of riding direct toward the camp, Maxwell pursued
a course that would carry him past it, at about a mile&rsquo;s distance,
with a considerable ridge intervening, intending to draw
the savages entirely away from the wagon-train, if possible,
but at any risk to protract the race until a more favorable
moment.</p>
<p>His thorough knowledge of the surrounding country now
stood him in good stead. The hills loomed up before him,
and the valley he was now in appeared to extend clear through
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
beyond the high ground, but in reality, it ended in a <i>cul de
sac</i>, from which escape would be almost impossible.</p>
<p>Veering a little to the right, he dashed on, with an occasional
glance back at his pursuers. He was gratified to see
that he at any rate had maintained his vantage-ground, and,
barring an accident, he felt confident of baffling pursuit until
the shades of night afforded him secure cover.</p>
<p>Maxwell knew that by rounding the now near hill, he
would find a clear route to the plains beyond, whose small
<i>mottes</i> of timber were scattered at short intervals. Close along
the further side of these hills, the river ran; then making an
abrupt turn, flowed through the level ground.</p>
<p>Maxwell was much attached to &ldquo;Ebenezer,&rdquo; his horse, but
when it was placed against the welfare of the train, and that
of Clara Calhoun, for whom he had taken a deep and fervent
liking, he did not hesitate. He resolved to abandon the mustang,
and trust to good fortune to recover him again.</p>
<p>Still, at nearly a mile in advance of his pursuers, the guide
rounded the hill, and reached the river side. Dismounting,
he struck the horse a sharp blow, and thus turned him loose.
True to his plans, Ebenezer dashed madly away up the river,
toward the nearest clump of timber, with a wild snort of
alarm and pain.</p>
<p>Running along a few yards in an opposite direction, Maxwell
crouched down in a rocky hollow, with a fast-beating
heart and an anxious face. He knew that, was his ruse discovered
too soon, his life would be forfeited, beyond all doubt.
True, he still held his rifle and revolvers, but what would his
one arm avail against those of over three-score savages?</p>
<p>He saw the mustang disappear behind the <i>motte</i>, at full
speed, and hoped that his pursuers had not yet gained a position
from whence they could note the absence of its rider.
If they had not, then he felt that he was safe.</p>
<p>Then the enemy spurred swiftly by, following keenly upon
the plain trail, without a pause or single glance around the
point. Then they, too, passed behind the timber island.</p>
<p>Chuckling heartily, Tom arose and entering the water, ran
lightly along its edge, until he came to a small log, lying upon
the shore. Rolling this into the water, the guide secured his
rifle upon it, and then entering the swift current, swam rapidly
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
down-stream, pushing the float before him, thus keeping
his gun and powder dry.</p>
<p>As he came in view of the wagon-train, he uttered a loud,
clear shout, and leaving the water, ran lightly toward the
camp, which was all confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tom? Where&rsquo;s your horse?&rdquo; excitedly asked
the major, as he met the old scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boun&rsquo; for Salt Lake, takin&rsquo; a wheen o&rsquo; pesky red-skins to
visit ol&rsquo; Brigham!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest what I say. But we hain&rsquo;t got no time to talk now&mdash;thar&rsquo;s
work to be did. Dusky Dick an&rsquo; a wheen o&rsquo; red
imps is on the rampage, red-hot fer ha&rsquo;r, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ll pay us a visit
afore sun-up to-morry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; anxiously queried Calhoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ca&rsquo;se I see&rsquo;d &rsquo;em. Don&rsquo;t jabber&mdash;<i>work!</i>&rdquo; impatiently
added Tom, as he entered the little corral.</p>
<p>He glanced around, anxiously taking in every detail, and
then added, in a voice of disgust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on airth was you fellers a-thinkin&rsquo; about, anyhow?
Don&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;d orter bin out yander, away from the
river? They kin swim down in the dark, an&rsquo; take us in the
r&rsquo;ar, now. But it&rsquo;s too late to mend <i>that</i> now, so do as I do.
They&rsquo;ll be here in less&rsquo;n a-nour now, fer they&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;re
on the look-out, soon&rsquo;s they find Ebenezer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corral had been formed close to the river-bank, in a
half-circle, and in the usual manner; that is, in two rows of
wagons, the one covering the joints in the other. By Tom
Maxwell&rsquo;s directions, the wheels were let down in holes
hastily dug, so that the axles rested upon the prairie, and the
openings were still further barricaded by articles taken from
the wagons.</p>
<p>The fires were extinguished and the women and children
stowed away in as perfect security as could be obtained, in
the inner tier of vehicles. But while doing so, a startling
discovery was made.</p>
<p>There was one missing&mdash;Clara Calhoun was in no place to be
found! A few minutes&rsquo; quest showed them that she was not
within the corral!</p>
<p>And then Maxwell found that his horse was also missing
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
from the others. In an agony of apprehension, Calhoun
hastened to and fro, eagerly questioning each one as to when
they had last noticed her.</p>
<p>All he could learn was simply this: Clara had been riding,
as usual, and at some little distance to one side of the train,
just before Tom Maxwell started out on his reconnoissance.
During the confusion anent the encamping, she had been lost
sight of. No one could say more than this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do, Tom?&rdquo; anxiously asked Calhoun, to the
gloomy guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, onless she comes in o&rsquo; herself. The reds is
snoopin&rsquo; &rsquo;round, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ll be most sartin to gobble up any as
goes out to hunt fer her. But I&rsquo;ll resk it, anyhow, fer a bit.
Keep the boys to work, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t git fooled, &rsquo;fore I come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old guide left the corral and hastened along the
back trail, soon disappearing amid the fast-gathering shadows.
And thus an hour passed by, when the whistle of Maxwell
was heard, followed in a few moments by himself; but he was
<i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good Lord on&rsquo;y knows, boss. Leastways, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t.
Didn&rsquo;t see hide nor ha&rsquo;r o&rsquo; her. But the reds is a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they know where we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon so; but ef not, they&rsquo;ll soon find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they <i>do</i> find us, how do you think it&rsquo;ll end, Maxwell?&rdquo;
queried an emigrant, in a tone of anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kin tell better a&rsquo;ter it&rsquo;s over, fri&rsquo;nd,&rdquo; dryly replied Tom,
with a significant shrug. &ldquo;But ef they don&rsquo;t git no more to
help &rsquo;em, why we stand a fa&rsquo;r show. They&rsquo;re on&rsquo;y three to
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Only!</i> And isn&rsquo;t that enough, for conscience sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fri&rsquo;nd, where a feller is fightin&rsquo; fer his wife an&rsquo; lettle
ones, he&rsquo;s ekil to <i>four</i>, what&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y themselves,&rdquo; and then silence
once more reigned throughout the corral, at least so far
as conversation was concerned.</p>
<p>But as may be imagined, the suspense and misgiving of the
father, with others, was terrible, when they thought of what
might have befallen the missing maiden. It was well that
the welfare of the train helped to divide their thoughts.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Without some such duty, their thoughts would have been
doubly distracting.</p>
<p>It was plain that nothing more could be done, until after
the threatened peril had passed. Until then, they could only
hope and pray that no serious evil might befall the wanderer.</p>
<p>Thus far, nothing had been seen or heard of the savages,
and a number of the emigrants half-believed that the old
guide had been deceived, and that the party of red-skins had
been peaceable ones, who had no designs upon the train.</p>
<p>The sky was clear and unclouded, and the full moon had
already arisen. Whether this last fact was a blessing or
otherwise, was an open question to the emigrants, for if it
served to betray the enemy in case they attempted a surprise,
it would likewise furnish sufficient light by which the death-dealing
bullet, or the scarcely less to be dreaded arrow, could
be directed with almost the certainty of one at midday.</p>
<p>As an off-set to the error in corraling the wagons upon the
river-bank, there were no trees or bushes within short gunshot
of the encampment, while the plain was level and smooth
almost as a floor, so that, for over an hundred yards, the savages
would be forced to advance right in the teeth of their
enemy.</p>
<p>Old Tom Maxwell was regarded by all as a sort of leader,
and each word he spoke was earnestly listened to, and every
hint or direction promptly obeyed, without a murmur or a
protest.</p>
<p>It was some two hours or more, after the moon had arisen,
that the first sign of the enemy&rsquo;s presence was observed, and
only the well-trained eye of the old guide could at first discern
the suspicious object. He quickly glided from man to
man, whispering to each:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a red out yon&rsquo;, snoopin&rsquo; &rsquo;round, to diskiver ef so be
we&rsquo;re on the look-out. Now don&rsquo;t spile it all, but take it
cool an&rsquo; do jest as I say. Ef he on&rsquo;y keeps to the outside,
why let &rsquo;im go, but ef he a&rsquo;tempts to enter, then wipe him
out as quickly as you know how. Don&rsquo;t make no n&rsquo;ise, nor
don&rsquo;t let him make none, nyther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he returned to his post, old Tom saw that the spy had
drawn considerably nearer, until the paint-bedaubed face
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
could be distinctly seen, as the moon&rsquo;s bright rays streamed
full upon the cautiously uplifted head.</p>
<p>The eyes of the veteran scout began to glisten, and his
hands nervously clutched at his rifle, as though eager to put
a final period to the night-prowling of the painted demon,
but then his habitual coolness returned, and he calmly awaited
the denouement.</p>
<p>The spy gradually drew nearer to the double row of
wagons, and paused close beside the outer line, just in front
of Maxwell. He uttered a low grunt as of disgust, as he
found that the beds were almost upon a level with the
ground, and that he could not pass beneath them, as he evidently
intended.</p>
<p>Then he turned aside and slowly began skirting the corral.
Although it was a trying ordeal, the emigrants obeyed their
leader&rsquo;s orders to the very letter, even suspending their breath
as the spy gently stole along the line.</p>
<p>Apparently this worthy became fully convinced that the
emigrants were soundly sleeping in false security, for he at
length began to climb over the barricade. Perhaps he was
after plunder, or mayhap he was a young brave, burning to
distinguish himself and to win a name among his people, by
taking the first scalp.</p>
<p>But if so, he was doomed never to realize his dream, for
as he leaped lightly to the ground, a pair of strong hands
were instantly twined around his throat, effectually checking
all outcry, while another of the emigrants plunged a keen
knife deep into the broad, swelling chest. One faint,
gurgling groan, a convulsive quiver, and the spirit of the red-man
fled from the ghastly wound and took up the trail to the
happy hunting-grounds.</p>
<p>Tom Maxwell glided quickly to the scene of death, and
bent eagerly over the corpse, scanning its features closely by
the clear moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dratted &rsquo;Rapahoe, boys, but I don&rsquo;t know him.
You did it up slick, but it&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y jest a beginnin&rsquo;; they&rsquo;ll send
out another, when he don&rsquo;t come back on time, to l&rsquo;arn
what&rsquo;s up. So hunker down an&rsquo; wait. Don&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; you
fire, though, ontel I give the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps another half-hour slowly dragged its weary length
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
along, before any thing more occurred to break this painful
suspense, and then another dusky form was observed coming
from much the same direction as that followed by the ill-fated
spy. They all knew that the crisis was now close at
hand, and every nerve was steeled, and though many a heart
beat faster than usual, there was none that fluttered with
fear.</p>
<p>The second spy had advanced to within a dozen yards of
the corral, when one of the eagerly watching emigrants fell
forward, and accidentally touched the trigger of his cocked
rifle. The sharp report rung out upon the still night-air,
sounding to the startled men like the roar of artillery.</p>
<p>At the same moment the spy arose to his feet and turned
to flee, uttering a wild whoop of alarm. But it was his last
cry upon earth, for the quick eye of Maxwell directed the
unerring rifle, and at the red skin&rsquo;s second leap, the quick report
rung out, and the second victim of the list that was yet
to follow, died without a groan.</p>
<p>Like an accompaniment to the double shot, there came a
blood-curdling chorus of yells and whoops, and a horde of
dusky fiends were seen to spring up as if from the bowels
of the earth, upon the level plain beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, boys! here they come!&rdquo; yelled old Tom, as
he sprung to his feet and began rapidly reloading his rifle.
&ldquo;Take it cool, but gi&rsquo;e them h&mdash;l. It&rsquo;s fer life, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the dusky fiends swarmed close to the barricade, a
blinding flash rose along the line, and at such near quarters,
the effect was deadly in the extreme. Shrill cries of agony
were blended with yells of rage, as a number of assailants
fell, dead or dying, before the scathing volley.</p>
<p>The savages paused, as if in stupor, and then as the terrible
quick-repeating revolvers began to play upon their crowded
ranks, their ardor suddenly cooled, and as if by magic they
disappeared, leaving their fallen as they lay, upon the field.
A wild exultant shout followed them, for it seemed as if the
repulse was complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your breath, boys,&rdquo; said the veteran guide, with a
silent but joyous laugh; &ldquo;fer you&rsquo;ll need it, every smich,
afore day. This is on&rsquo;y the primin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the rail airnest work
is yit to come. Fodder up an&rsquo; look out fer breakers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think they&rsquo;ll make another attack?&rdquo; anxiously
queried Major Calhoun, who stood beside Maxwell, reloading
his weapons with the rapidity of an expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet Ebenezer ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; a jack-rabbit&mdash;which is long odds&mdash;that
they will. They didn&rsquo;t know we was ready for &rsquo;em, but
they&rsquo;ve l&rsquo;arnt a lesson now, an&rsquo; they never need more&rsquo;n one
o&rsquo; thet kind to open thar eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was probably the reason of the strange recklessness and
want of caution that the Indians had exhibited, for such is
not their usual nature. They most likely believed that the
shots had been fired by an alarmed sentinel, and then made
their quick rush, hoping to overpower the startled and bewildered
emigrants before they were well awakened and aware
of the real facts.</p>
<p>And then, when greeted in such a deadly manner, they
perceived the error they had fallen into, fleeing in confusion
and momentary dismay. But as the old guide had predicted,
the worst was yet to come, and the savages would be doubly
desperate now, from the heavy loss they had experienced.</p>
<p>Their approaches now would be all the more to be dreaded,
because they would be conducted with all caution and subtleness.</p>
<p>During the entire assault and repulse, the savages had
scarce fired a dozen shots, and not one of the emigrants was
harmed, so well were they sheltered. But one of the horses,
who had all been tethered at either end of the barricade, near
the banks of the river, had been struck by a random bullet,
and killed.</p>
<p>As it alarmed the others, by Maxwell&rsquo;s direction, the body
was pushed over the bank into the river. And then each
man returned to his post, while those detailed to watch the
water side, retained their position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />A WILD RACE.</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, where was the missing maiden, Clara Calhoun?
Let us glance back and learn.</p>
<p>The information gleaned by Major Calhoun from the emigrants
was correct, so far as it went. Clara had been riding,
as usual, and when she had learned the spot chosen for the
encampment, which she could already locate by the neighboring
grove of trees, she resolved to enjoy a little gallop ere
night fell, and by this means she would also avoid much of
the disagreeable noise and confusion attendant upon halting.</p>
<p>So she bore abruptly to the right, and with loosened rein
dashed merrily away, the proud mustang tossing his head
gladly, at this unusual relaxation. But Clara&rsquo;s little ride was
destined to be carried out upon a scale of far greater importance
than she had anticipated, and ere it was ended, she was
fated to undergo a season of peculiar trial.</p>
<p>From before her horse&rsquo;s feet there sprung up a rabbit&mdash;one
of that overgrown breed popularly known as &ldquo;jack-rabbits,&rdquo;
which, if not often palmed off on greenhorns as full grown
mules, as Westerners frequently assert, are sufficiently large to
astonish those used only to the more diminutive species common
to &ldquo;the States&rdquo;&mdash;and dashed away over the short grass,
clearing fully half a score yards at each jump.</p>
<p>Clara&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and bending forward she spoke to
her horse in a low tone, gently touching his flanks with her
switch. The game creature bounded forward with a wild
snort, while the maiden laughed long and loudly at this unique
race.</p>
<p>The jack-rabbit, like his more diminutive brother of the
States, invariably resorts to one ruse, in order to escape an
enemy. It will flee for a considerable distance in a direct
line, but then will &ldquo;double,&rdquo; and return by a <i>detour</i> to near
the starting-point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>And this one was not an exception to the general rule.
For fully a mile it leaped ahead, with astonishing speed, leaving
Clara far behind, and then doubled.</p>
<p>But Clara did not detect this last move, and urged her horse
on at full speed. Then, however, having lost sight of the
animal, she drew rein and turned as if to retrace her steps.</p>
<p>She glanced around, but the point toward which she believed
was the camping-ground was bare and like that upon
either hand. Not a tree was to be seen. The plain was
nearly level, but she was now in a slight depression, that
was from right to left, like the trough between two huge
waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, us she twitched the reins and turned the
mustang&rsquo;s head toward the crest, &ldquo;we must hurry, or we&rsquo;ll be
too late for supper. It&rsquo;s almost sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then, as she paused upon the ridge, a wild cry broke
from her lips. A startling sight met her gaze.</p>
<p>Before her, at not more than one-half mile distance, were
a number of horsemen, coming toward her at full speed.
And even her untrained eyes could tell that they were Indians;
their trappings and peculiar manner of riding, outlined
upon the red sky beyond, as they crossed a slight swell, told
her that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! I am lost!&rdquo; gasped Clara, for she believed that
these forms were directly between her and her friends, unknowing
how the chase after the rabbit had caused her to deviate
from a true line.</p>
<p>But then as a shrill cry came to her ears, borne over the
intervening space by the light breeze, she wrenched her
horse&rsquo;s head around and dashed down the slope at a break-neck
pace. Only one thought possessed her now: to increase
the distance between her and these dusky fiends, of whose
daring she had heard so many frightful incidents.</p>
<p>And now the race was begun in sober earnest. It was no
longer one of mere sport; freedom, perhaps even life depended
upon her retaining the vantage-ground thus fortunately
gained.</p>
<p>The truth may be told in a few words. These savages
were but part of the band that had pursued old Tom Maxwell,
who, after discovering the riderless horse, had suspected
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the ruse, and were searching for the emigrant train. They
had caught sight of Clara, just after she set off in pursuit of
the rabbit, and a band of them immediately spurred forth to
effect her capture.</p>
<p>There was one circumstance in Clara&rsquo;s favor, though she
did not think of it then. The sun had already sunk behind
the western horizon, and in a short time more, the shades of
night would hide her from her enemies, provided she could
elude their clutches for so long.</p>
<p>But then she knew not whither she was going. Ignorant
of what lay before her, in a strange and wild region, what
hope was there for her?</p>
<p>Even supposing she should escape these enemies, how could
she subsist in that wide prairie, destitute of food, or even the
means of procuring any? She would only starve to death,
die by slow degrees!</p>
<p>And thus she sped on, carefully assisting her noble horse,
as he labored on. Fortunate indeed it was for her that he
was a mustang, prairie born and bred; tough and hardy,
though not remarkably fleet at a short stretch.</p>
<p>But one of this race will easily tire out and even kill one
of the larger breed from the States, and yet, after a short rest
and mouthful of short grass, be as well and fresh as ever.
For hours they can be urged on at full speed, without giving
way beneath the strain.</p>
<p>And so, though beneath the saddle well-nigh that entire day,
Clara&rsquo;s horse sped on without flinching, and the maiden saw
with joy that she was nearly, if not quite, maintaining her
vantage ground.</p>
<p>But still, of what avail? How would it all end? She
was fleeing further with each moment, from her friends, and
in trying to avoid one death, seemed but rushing upon another,
scarcely less terrible.</p>
<p>For fully an hour the race swept on, without any great
change in the relative positions. The shades of night were
now upon the prairie, and the moon not yet having risen, all
around was dark and gloomy.</p>
<p>Clara could see that she was nearing high ground, but as
she looked to see if she could not skirt it, the dim outlines of
a long range met her eye, extending for miles upon either
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
hand. Though fearful of losing ground, there was nothing
for it but to dare the steep ascent.</p>
<p>In a few minutes more, the fugitive was at the base of a
rugged hill, and then as the shrill yells of exultation came up
from the pursuers behind her, Clara urged her laboring horse
up the steep ascent.</p>
<p>It was hard work for the already overtasked animal, but
it nobly responded to the call, and although more than once
stumbling, it struggled on until the extreme crest was gained.
But then as it dashed down the steep declivity, the mustang&rsquo;s
hoof rested upon a loose stone, and it pitched forward, head-first,
flinging its rider violently to the ground. Then arising,
it still kept on, snorting wildly.</p>
<p>Clara felt a shock, then that she was falling&mdash;falling down
what seemed an interminable depth, and then, with a frightful
shock her downward course seemed to be checked. This;
and then followed a blank.</p>
<p>A blank, so far as any definite sensation was concerned,
and yet not entirely one, either. For it seemed&mdash;faint and
indistinct, as in a dream&mdash;as though she was shortly afterward
surrounded by phantom figures, and a far-away hum as
of human voices in consultation, was also in the vision, if
vision it was.</p>
<p>The figures seemed to raise her from the ground and then
convey her gently through the air for what seemed an almost
interminable length of time. Then she was placed upon
the cool ground beside a murmuring rivulet, when cool water
was sprinkled over her face, while warm, soft hands chafed
her own.</p>
<p>Then with a feeble cry she started up and gazed wildly
around her. The phantom forms were now more substantial&mdash;the
voices sounded more clearly upon her ear, and she
knew that the visionary dream had been a reality.</p>
<p>Then she uttered a feeble cry and sunk back, with a convulsive
shudder. Before her she beheld a hideous face, dusky,
it seemed, with nodding plumes surmounting it, that she
knew could only belong to an Indian!</p>
<p>She felt that she was lost&mdash;that her pursuers had overtaken
her, and that now she was helpless in the power of the
merciless fiends!</p>

<br />THE FORLORN HOPE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that Dusky Dick is with them, Maxwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would sw&rsquo;ar it, boss, ef that wasn&rsquo;t ag&rsquo;in my natur&rsquo;,&rdquo;
promptly replied the old borderer, as he seated himself beside
his loop-hole, and coolly began cutting a plug of tobacco
into bits, to fill the pipe that he held in his mouth, as he
spoke. &ldquo;But I tell you he&rsquo;s <i>thar</i>. I didn&rsquo;t see him when
those galoots was a&rsquo;ter old Ebenezer, but they was in a crowd,
an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t hev time to look good. But I kin <i>smell</i> him,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smell him!&rdquo; echoed Calhoun, somewhat astonished at
the positive tone of the old guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas, sir,&rdquo; quoth Tom, cramming the tobacco into the
pipe-bowl. &ldquo;You know thar <i>is</i> sech a thing as <i>smell</i>, don&rsquo;t
ye? Wal, then, one thing smells like somethin&rsquo; else, an&rsquo; then
ag&rsquo;in another <i>don&rsquo;t</i>. See?&rdquo; selecting a match from a small
pocket-safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t risk a light here, now, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger, boss, fer as you&rsquo;ll see, when <i>I</i> make a light,
thar hain&rsquo;t a smich o&rsquo; light to be see&rsquo;d; that is, onless you
look whar it is, an&rsquo; then you won&rsquo;t see it, nuther,&rdquo; laying his
old slouched hat upon the ground, over the handle of his
knife.</p>
<p>Then he lay down, protruding his pipe-bowl beneath the
hat, and striking a match, ignited the pipe without betraying
a light larger than that of a glow-worm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, some things kin be did &rsquo;s well &rsquo;s others, ef so be
you know jest how to do it. But as I was sayin&rsquo;, I kin smell
that pesky varmint, Dusky Dick. Dif&rsquo;rent folks is dif&rsquo;rent,
you know, but then they&rsquo;re all alike, too, a&rsquo;ter all. Now
then thar&rsquo;s Miss Clary; she smells jest like a gre&rsquo;t big bnn&rsquo;le
o&rsquo; posies, figur&rsquo;tively speakin&rsquo;, in course. Then thar&rsquo;s you&mdash;sorter
like a persimming. Ef a feller bites you at the wrong
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
time, why he&rsquo;d a heap ruther squat down bar&rsquo;-legged onto a
big ho&rsquo;nets&rsquo; nest than to do it ag&rsquo;in. But ef the sign is right,
then it&rsquo;s jest like b&rsquo;iled honey, unly more so. Then ag&rsquo;in,
furder an&rsquo; more so, thar&rsquo;s Jack Wilson. <i>He</i> smells jest like
a bottle o&rsquo; pepper-sass. A lettle is mighty good, but ef you
gits too much, why you&rsquo;re boun&rsquo; to sneeze an&rsquo; go a-milkin&rsquo;.
So Dusky Dick smells like a copperhead or a rattler. I tell
you he&rsquo;s <i>thar</i>, all ready for bitin&rsquo;, for <i>I smells &rsquo;im</i>!&rdquo; earnestly
declared Maxwell, smoking vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out yonder, Tom, where that little ridge of sand
ends,&rdquo; suddenly whispered Calhoun, touching the old guide
upon the shoulder. &ldquo;What is that long, dark thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s scrutiny of the suspicious-looking object,
Maxwell replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks su&rsquo;thin&rsquo; like a chunk cut out o&rsquo; a black cloud,
don&rsquo;t it? Reckon &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t, though, come to think. Would be
a Injun ef &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t somethin&rsquo; else. &rsquo;Sides, it&rsquo;s too big an&rsquo; too
long an&rsquo; too much so all over, for a red. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t a canoe,
nuther, &rsquo;cause thar hain&rsquo;t no water thar. I&rsquo;d go out an&rsquo; ax
its name, on&rsquo;y I&rsquo;m &rsquo;feered it&rsquo;d rare up an&rsquo; onsettle my supper,&rdquo;
slowly drawled the old guide, evidently talking from mere
force of habit, without heeding what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely moves&mdash;see! It&rsquo;s closer now than when I first
noticed it!&rdquo; anxiously added Calhoun, nervously handling his
rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy&mdash;easy, boss, or you&rsquo;ll skeer the durned thing so bad
it&rsquo;ll run off, right spang-a-diddle through us,&rdquo; continued Tom,
the while keenly eying the nondescript. &ldquo;It <i>does</i> move, by
ge-mently! but I don&rsquo;t see no legs, an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t no sarpint,
&rsquo;less it&rsquo;s swallered its own head an&rsquo; tail. Mebbe it&rsquo;s a whale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the emigrants now came up beside them, and called
their attention to a similar object at a little distance to the
left, that had puzzled the others in the same manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, boss,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, in a vexed tone,
&ldquo;thar&rsquo;s jest the biggest set o&rsquo; fools &rsquo;round these diggin&rsquo;s as
was ever got together in one heap, I jest bet my pile! <i>They</i>
was fools for thinkin&rsquo; they could fool us with them, an&rsquo; we
was bigger fools for gittin&rsquo; fooled by them dratted fool logs!
It&rsquo;s the beatin&rsquo;est foolery &rsquo;at I <i>ever</i> knowed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words explained the mystery, and the others were
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
as greatly surprised as had been the old scout, that they had
not penetrated the ruse sooner.</p>
<p>The Indians had procured a number of logs, and were now
busied in rolling them up toward the corral, evidently hoping
to thus gain a position from whence they could securely pick
off the defenders of the wagon-train at their own leisure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done, now, Tom?&rdquo; and the major could
not entirely conceal his uneasiness as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, jest kill a dozen o&rsquo; them loggerheads, an&rsquo; then the
others&rsquo;ll take the hint an&rsquo; leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot &rsquo;em, in course. You don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;ll let you
git cluss enough to do any thin&rsquo; else, do ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re hid behind the logs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef they keeps hid all the time, they won&rsquo;t do overly much
damage a-shootin&rsquo;, shore. No, <i>sir</i>! When a feller shoots,
his head hes got to be as high as the bar&rsquo;l, an&rsquo; ef <i>it&rsquo;s</i> atop o&rsquo;
the log, why don&rsquo;t you see? his head must be thar too, in
course, onless he&rsquo;s cross-eyed an&rsquo; kin shoot roun&rsquo; the corner,&rdquo;
argued Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon. We&rsquo;ll try it, anyhow, jest for beans. You
feller, go an&rsquo; send Wilson an&rsquo; Texas Joe here, quicker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few moments the two men designated were at hand,
and then Maxwell directed them what to do. The logs were
now within fifty yards of the outer wagons, and were still
drawing yet nearer, though slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunker down here, boys, an&rsquo; see that you&rsquo;re well kivered.
Ready? Now one o&rsquo; you fire to&rsquo;rds that log afore us. Don&rsquo;t
make no differ&rsquo; whether you aim at it or that big star yonder,
jest so you shoot; an&rsquo; then dodge down, quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gun was discharged as directed, at one of the stationary
logs, and instantly there came a return shot, evidently
aimed at this flash, for the bullet plowed up the dirt in close
proximity to the men.</p>
<p>Then like an echo the rifle of the guide spoke, and was
blended with a wild yell of death-agony, that told it had
not been discharged in vain, while a dark figure sprung high
up into the air, and falling, lay motionless upon the ground,
out in the open moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;See, boss,&rdquo; exultantly cried Maxwell, rolling quickly aside
from his loop-hole in time to avoid a return shot. &ldquo;I told
you &rsquo;at something could be did &rsquo;s well &rsquo;s others, an&rsquo; now you
see they kin, an&rsquo; better, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chorus of vindictive hoots and cries announced that the
enemy were any thing but pleased at the working of their
scheme, and then a general volley was fired from behind the
logs.</p>
<p>This time a cry uprose from the interior of the corral, and
then the word was passed around that one of the men was
killed. At this calamity&mdash;the first one of any importance&mdash;a
heavy gloom settled over the spirits of the defenders, for
they knew not but that ere the morning&rsquo;s sun should arise,
they would all have met the same dread fate.</p>
<p>But their attention was speedily diverted from this sad
thought, and their every energy required to avert the threatened
doom. The cry went up that another onset was at
hand.</p>
<p>With the never-failing yells and screeches, the foe sprung
up from behind their coverts, and swarmed forward like so
many phantoms of death; and then the air was filled with
the hissing bullets and hurtling arrows.</p>
<p>As before, a dazzling line of flame shot along the entire
length of the barricade, and so deadly was its effect that the
desperate onslaught was momentarily checked. Only momentarily,
though, and then there came a simultaneous shock
against the outer row of wagons, as the assailants gained this
shelter.</p>
<p>Then the enemies were separated by only a few feet, and
for a few fast-fleeting seconds there was a pause. It was
broken, however, by a shot from the corral, and as an Indian
uttered the death-shriek, his companions strove desperately to
scale the barricade.</p>
<p>Did they reveal their persons to the keen eyes of the besieged,
a bullet was speedily sent upon its deadly mission;
did they essay to crawl beneath or over the wagons, they
were met by pistol-shots, knife thrusts or clubbed rifles.</p>
<p>Nor were the defenders unscathed. More than one still
and ghastly form incumbered the interior of the corral, while
here and there writhed one in mortal agony, shrieking aloud,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
but with fast weakening accents, the names of his loved ones;
of those, who were even then, perchance, praying for his
safety, that he might pass that terrific ordeal unharmed.</p>
<p>Although old Tom Maxwell and Major Calhoun were
desperately busy, their voices were silent. There was little
need of orders then, for each man was nobly doing his duty,
and that lay plainly before him.</p>
<p>Then there came a loud shout from those men who were
stationed close to the extremities of the barricade, so as to
overlook the water&rsquo;s surface. A cry that announced some
new peril threatening their safety; a cry that was echoed
exultantly back by the demons in front, who now seemed to
redouble their efforts to scale the barrier.</p>
<p>Maxwell quickly gained one end of the corral, and beheld
the river&rsquo;s surface above their position, as well as directly in
front, close to the water&rsquo;s edge, dotted with sundry black objects
that needed but one glance to be recognized as logs,
bearing the firearms of savages, who were evidently sheltered
behind them, but at the same time drawing nearer to their
anticipated prey.</p>
<p>Those who exposed themselves first, on going to the
shore, were instantly saluted with a deadly volley of pistol-balls,
and for a brief space, the others hesitated, as if disconcerted.
They had evidently counted upon effecting an entrance
into the corral by surprise, while the emigrants were
engaged in repelling the attack of the main body, and then
overpowering their obstinate foes, but the forethought of the
veteran guide had baulked them.</p>
<p>Then rallying, they made a desperate rush, gaining the
shore, and several of them actually gaining the bank, entering
the corral, only to be hurled back, dead or dying, into the
water. For a brief space, it was a wild, horrible <i>melee</i>, desperate
and bloody.</p>
<p>The report of fire-arms&mdash;the occasional ringing of steel
against steel, as two foemen met in close contest&mdash;the confused
trampling to and fro&mdash;the shrill yell, either of rage or else of
death-agony&mdash;the defiant shouts and hoarse oaths&mdash;the affrighted
screams of the snorting horses&mdash;or the wail of some
terrified infant, all combined into one fearful tumult!</p>
<p>Then there came a long-drawn, quavering cry, and as if
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
by magic the savage assailants vanished, like hoar-frost before
the sun&rsquo;s warm breath. But there followed no exultant
shout from the emigrants.</p>
<p>As they glanced fearfully around upon the forms of their
dead and dying comrades, their hearts were rent with anguish
and apprehension. They saw but too plainly, that another
such triumph would be almost equivalent to a defeat.</p>
<p>While the majority still retained their posts, keenly vigilant,
others of the little band removed the dead into one place
and ministered to the wants of the wounded, to the best of
their ability. It was a sad and heart-rending task, but their
own peril was such that they had no time for bewailing their
comrade&rsquo;s sad fate, and then once more they returned to their
posts.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour all was silence within the little corral,
and even the sorely wounded, despite their agony, heroically
suppressed their moans of pain, lest they should tend to weaken
the nerves of the defenders still left. And the latter were
far too deeply occupied with their own thoughts upon the
impending peril to feel like conversing.</p>
<p>But, at the end of this time, there was one who could maintain
silence no longer&mdash;the old guide, Tom Maxwell. A voluble
talker, he seemed totally at a loss while his tongue was
idle, and, unlike most people, he appeared to think better and
more closely while dilating upon some entirely foreign subject.</p>
<p>Upon one side of him was stationed Major Calhoun; upon
the other, the young man, Buenos Ayres. It was with them,
either or both, that he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wuss&rsquo;n a Quaker meetin&rsquo;, this is, &rsquo;specially a&rsquo;ter sich lively
doin&rsquo;s as was jist now. &rsquo;Pears like I&rsquo;d bu&rsquo;st ef I was to hold
in any longer; the words scroudge each other so&rsquo;t they hain&rsquo;
got room to kick in. What d&rsquo;you think o&rsquo; the sitivation,
any how, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad&mdash;very bad!&rdquo; gloomily responded Calhoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true as gospil; but then &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t quite so bad as it
mought be ef it was wuss, anyhow, which is a gre&rsquo;t consolation.
I thought I was once in the wuss fix &rsquo;at ever could be
hatched up, when I was in the middle o&rsquo; a bayou, down in
Texas, with a passel o&rsquo; red-skins on &rsquo;ither hand, an&rsquo; three in
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
a canoe, cluss ahind me. But then a corntwisted alligator
poked his nose right up from the water, against mine, which
mixed things up a little more so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I div&rsquo;&mdash;the canoe ran smack inside the critter&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;thar
was a scrunch, an&rsquo; then mebbe thar wasn&rsquo;t some splashin&rsquo;!
I swum in &rsquo;mongst the reeds, while the reds was flustrated,
an&rsquo; so fooled &rsquo;em. All of which goes to prove that we
ain&rsquo;t cotched yit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that Dusky Dick is with these devils, to-night?
I have neither seen nor heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet yer life he is. But he hain&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;s fool, an&rsquo; knows
well enough that ef he should show his ugly mug, it&rsquo;d bring
a dozen bullets a&rsquo;ter it. Most like, he&rsquo;s painted up like one
o&rsquo; the rest; but he&rsquo;s <i>thar</i>, shure. I smell him, I tell ye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never heerd tell o&rsquo; <i>two</i> sech attacks as them, right
tergether, &rsquo;thout somebody hed a partic&rsquo;lar grudge to work out,
or objeck to gain. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t Injun nature, <i>it</i> ain&rsquo;t. Most like
they&rsquo;re a gang o&rsquo; outcast an&rsquo; vaggarbonds as he&rsquo;s picked up
somewhars, to do his dirty work, an&rsquo; this &rsquo;ere ain&rsquo;t the <i>fust</i>
time, nuther, you mark <i>me</i>. No wonder he&rsquo;s called an unlucky
guide fer the <i>trains</i>,&rdquo; added Maxwell, significantly; and
then he proceeded once more to fill his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped he was not with them, for then I should not
feel so uneasy about the result. I think we can beat them off
once more, anyhow, and if they were only after plunder,
their loss would soon sicken them. But if <i>he</i> is there, I fear
the worst,&rdquo; added Calhoun, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest so; you talk right to the spot, <i>you</i> do&mdash;a&rsquo;ter my own
style. Never did fancy them fellers what jabbered so much
&rsquo;mongst sech a heep o&rsquo; words; &rsquo;t stands to reason thar must
be <i>some</i> lyin&rsquo;; an&rsquo; I hate a liar like all ge-mently&mdash;I do <i>so</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a sad mistake, our leaving the regular trail,&rdquo; observed
young Ayres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it turns out, yes. But &rsquo;twar fer the best, then. Water&rsquo;s
sca&rsquo;ce on that route this dry weather. We did it fer the best.
But why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we might hope for help from some other train.
As it is, we&rsquo;re too far off for them to hear the fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas; thar ears hain&rsquo;t long enough. Ketch a lot o&rsquo; jack-rabbits
an&rsquo; chouge &rsquo;th &rsquo;em. Mules, too. Lord, yas!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Maxwell, what do you mean?&rdquo; and Calhoun gazed
anxiously at the old scout, whose eyes appeared fixed intently
upon a bright star, while a vacant stare rested upon his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;let him alone, major,&rdquo; whispered Buenos. &ldquo;He
don&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s talking. I believe he sees some way to fool
these devils, and is settling the details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And such was indeed the case. The words of Ayers had
given a hint to the quick-witted guide, that he was not slow
to take hold of. From mere force of habit, his tongue shaped
words of which he was unconscious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar! I&rsquo;ve got it! We&rsquo;ll fool the imps yit, by ge-mineezers!
That is, we will ef we do; an&rsquo; ef we don&rsquo;t, why, we
will, <i>any</i>how. No use talkin&rsquo;&mdash;we <i>must</i> do it,&rdquo; and the guide
uttered a deep sigh of relief, as he glanced, first at one, then
at the other, of his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what? What do you mean, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lis&rsquo;en. I said we&rsquo;d fool them imps, an&rsquo; I b&rsquo;lieve we kin
do it. I don&rsquo;t say we kin, <i>fer shore</i>, but I think so. A feller
mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your plan&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; impatiently interrupted Calhoun.
&ldquo;There is no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s another day a-comin&rsquo;, boss,&rdquo; coolly added Maxwell,
his tones telling that his mind was still busied with the
details of his plan. &ldquo;No need to be in a hurry. Know&rsquo;d a
feller to <i>die</i>, onc&rsquo;t, &rsquo;cause he was in too big a hurry. Got lost
thar&mdash;starved to death afore he could find his way out. Thar,
it&rsquo;s <i>did</i>&mdash;<i>now</i> listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fust, we&rsquo;re here&mdash;<i>they&rsquo;re</i> thar, an&rsquo; somebody else is in
t&rsquo;other place. We must find that t&rsquo;other somebody. See?&rdquo;
hastily spluttered Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>how</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;member the train we left at Dutchman&rsquo;s Crick&mdash;the
sojer one? It couldn&rsquo;t travel much faster &rsquo;n we did, so it
must be not very fur away now, on t&rsquo;other trail. We must
get word to them. Now fer the <i>how</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One o&rsquo; us&mdash;a volunteer ef thar is one&mdash;ef not, I&rsquo;ll try it&mdash;must
drop over thar in the drink, an&rsquo; swim down ontel he kin
git out &rsquo;thout the reds seein&rsquo; him. Then he must putt out,
hot fut, an&rsquo; not stop fer nothin&rsquo; ontel he strikes t&rsquo;other trail
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Then ef the big train hes goed by, he must ketch up &rsquo;th it. Ef
not, then he must go t&rsquo;other way ontel he finds it. That did,
he&rsquo;ll tell o&rsquo; our sitivation an&rsquo; bring help&mdash;twenty sojers &rsquo;ll do,
&rsquo;th what we hev here. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can the trail be found, Tom? Won&rsquo;t whoever attempts
it, get lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s the no&rsquo;th star&mdash;he kin keep that on his right
shoulder. He <i>cain&rsquo;t</i> miss it&mdash;the trail runs from eend to eend&mdash;onless
he goes t&rsquo;other way. You stay here, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go see
what the boys say &rsquo;bout it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need of that, I will make the venture,&rdquo; said Buenos,
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;no, lad. I&rsquo;d ruther go myself. It&rsquo;ll be resky&mdash;no
two to one a feller&rsquo;ll git through. Think o&rsquo; Miss Clary,&rdquo; earnestly
responded Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;I have. She is lost, and every moment that we
let go by but adds to the danger of our never finding her.
The sooner we are free to search for her, the better her
chances are. I will not lose any time, and the thought that
I am working for her, will help me through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is right, Tom,&rdquo; answered Calhoun. &ldquo;He can do this
as well as you can, and besides, he can hardly fill your place
here. We need some one who is up to the dodges of the
red devils, or we are lost indeed. You must stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, but I don&rsquo;t like it. Still, it may be best.
I&rsquo;d ruther trust him then ary other one as would go, now
Texas Joe is rubbed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any further instructions to give?&rdquo; asked Ayres,
as he tightened the belt around his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;on&rsquo;y take keer o&rsquo; yourself. &rsquo;Member that the life o&rsquo;
the hull pack o&rsquo; us&mdash;and mebbe that o&rsquo; Miss Clary, too&mdash;depends
on your gittin&rsquo; through all hunky. It&rsquo;d be too late to
try a-nother one, ef you&mdash;thunder! you <i>won&rsquo;t</i> git rubbed out!
Ef you do, durned ef I don&rsquo;t jest up an&rsquo; swaller every pesky
red-skin out yender, alive, an&rsquo; then send Dusky Dick down
a&rsquo;ter, to keep &rsquo;em stirred up lively. I will so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, I&rsquo;ll go now. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell the boys how it
is, till you know whether I get through safe or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave your rifle here&mdash;tie a &rsquo;volver on top o&rsquo; your head,
so it&rsquo;ll be dry an&rsquo; ready fer use, ef you should chaince to run
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; any o&rsquo; the varmints. Swim cluss to the bank, whar it
throws a shadder, an&rsquo; take your time ontel you git a safe distance.
Then let your legs went. Don&rsquo;t stop to look ef you&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to tread on ary bug or nothin&rsquo;&mdash;let &rsquo;em squ&rsquo;sh ef they
don&rsquo;t git outen the way. Onderstand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, and God bless and protect you, my boy,&rdquo; uttered
Calhoun, chokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&mdash;git out! You&rsquo;ve filled my eyes full o&rsquo; bugs or
so&rsquo;thin&rsquo;, a&rsquo;ready. Ef the reds come now, I couldn&rsquo;t shoot a
mite. Thar&mdash;now you&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; and the old guide pressed
the young man&rsquo;s hand warmly, while he brushed one sleeve
across his eyes, now dimmed by a suspicious moisture.</p>
<p>Cautiously Ayres glided along the barricade, and slipping
down the bank&mdash;here several yards high&mdash;entered the water.
Then sinking low down, and keeping within the narrow belt
of dark shadow, he slowly floated down-stream, fairly bound
upon his truly perilous mission.</p>
<p>And with painfully-throbbing hearts the two men listened,
dreading lest there should come to their ears with each passing
moment, the exultant shout of their savage foes, announcing
the discovery of the young man, thus foiling their last
hope&mdash;a truly forlorn one!</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />DELAWARE TOM.</h2>
<p>Clara uttered a wild cry, and sunk back, with a shudder.
She believed her pursuers had overtaken, and now held her
captive; but in this she was mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be alarmed, lady,&rdquo; uttered a low voice, close beside
the maiden. &ldquo;You are among friends here, who will
protect you with their lives, if there be any need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&mdash;he is an Indian!&rdquo; half unconsciously murmured
Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but he is far different from those who were chasing
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
you. He is a true friend, and would fight in your defense
quite as readily as I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bes&rsquo; git back little furder. Injun shoot plenty straight
by dis light. Ketch hoss&mdash;den be back, bumbye. Bes&rsquo; hide
in bushes up dere, den Injun go by&mdash;won&rsquo;t see um,&rdquo; interrupted
a guttural voice, evidently proceeding from the lips of
the Indian alluded to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Tom. They&rsquo;ll be apt to follow back on
their own trail, to see where she gave them the slip. Do you
think you can walk, Miss?&rdquo; he added, turning toward Clara;
&ldquo;or shall I carry you? There is danger in lingering here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&mdash;I will walk. If you lend me your arm I
think&mdash; Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara rose to her feet by clinging to the strong arm of her
new-found friend, but then, with an agonized groan, she would
have fallen to the ground, had not his arms encircled her
fainting form. The violent fall had evidently injured the
maiden far more severely than she had at first believed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead the way, Delaware,&rdquo; muttered the man, as he raised
the girl in his arms. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian turned and glided along the level plat for a
few yards, then began ascending a steep incline. Up this for
a considerable distance; then he paused before a dense
growth of bushes, that seemed to shoot out from the very face
of the bank.</p>
<p>The man bearing Clara was quickly beside his red companion,
and then they all entered the bushes, disappearing
from sight.</p>
<p>This spot was upon a hillside, at whose base ran a clear
stream of water. Beyond this, again, was a level strip of
ground, studded thickly with little clumps of trees and undergrowth.</p>
<p>The three persons were ensconced within the bushes, close
against the rocks, that uprose, bare and gray, for nearly a
dozen yards, sloping so that a stone dropped from the escarpment
above, would touch the ground several yards out
from the base. This cliff, however, only extended for a short
distance upon either hand; then it ran out into a steep hillside,
down which, on one hand, Clara had been cast by the
stumbling of her horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; asked the white man, after a
moment&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, though still faint and dizzy. But how&mdash; I remember
falling, and then all is blank. How did you find
me, and where am I? There were some Indians chasing me;
where are they?&rdquo; confusedly asked Clara, in a faint tone.</p>
<p>In a few quick words the stranger explained the part he
had played in the adventure.</p>
<p>He was an officer of a Government train of supplies, and
had started out on a scout, together with one of their guides,
an Indian named Delaware Tom, but had become belated
while following up a trail. They had resolved to encamp
for the night, when they were aroused by wild yells and the
sound of hoof-strokes.</p>
<p>Then they saw a woman rise the hill&rsquo;s crest, and almost
immediately fall from her horse, as it stumbled. He sprung
forward and caught her, while Delaware Tom crept to the
hill-top to learn what had so alarmed her.</p>
<p>He soon made out the figures of the pursuing savages, and
then the two scouts had hidden in the bushes, with the unconscious
maiden, until the war-party had thundered by, in
hot pursuit of the riderless horse. Then they had hastened
with Clara to the creek, where they succeeded in restoring
her to consciousness, by the plentiful use of water, aided by
a stronger fluid incased in a flask carried by the captain.</p>
<p>And then Clara briefly detailed her portion of the adventure,
adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do not thank you for this service, it is because I can
not find words to express my feelings. I would rather die
than fall into <i>their</i> power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks are not needed, believe me. I am amply repaid
already for the trifle I was enabled to do, by knowing you
are safe from those fiends. But you spoke of your father&mdash;is
it possible that he is my old commandant, Major John Calhoun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He served in Mexico, and his given name is John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the same, then! Did you never hear him
speak of Harold Travers? He saved my life at Cerro Gordo,&rdquo;
eagerly added the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have; he often mentions your name. And now
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
you repay that debt by saving the life of his daughter. He
has often wondered where you were, and it will be a happy
meeting; one that I trust will take place very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bes&rsquo; not mek talk now,&rdquo; interrupted Indian Tom, significantly.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Rapahoe he come back plenty soon. Find hoss&mdash;mad
like de debble &rsquo;cause don&rsquo;t fin&rsquo; squaw, too. Hunt
fo&rsquo; her heap, mebbe. Won&rsquo;t git her, dough, &rsquo;less kin whip
<i>us</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Delaware. I can hear the sound of their
horses&rsquo; hoofs on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they coming? My God! I thought I had escaped
them for good!&rdquo; moaned Clara, fearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, Miss Calhoun,&rdquo; returned Travers. &ldquo;They
shall not harm you, even if they chance to discover us. There
are only half a dozen in all, and surely we two can manage
them. Can&rsquo;t we, Delaware?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, fo&rsquo; sure. Don&rsquo;t know much how mek fight, &rsquo;Rapahoe.
Big cowards, dey is. Got white man &rsquo;long, dough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See um. Know um, too. Name Dusky Dick. Big
decoy. White Injins&mdash;plenty bad&mdash;more so dan oders. Play
snake fo&rsquo; train, so Injin git &rsquo;em,&rdquo; tersely added the Indian.</p>
<p>Clara uttered a faint cry of apprehension, at the sound of
his name, for she knew that now indeed she was in danger.
The threats of Dusky Dick came back to memory with renewed
force, and knowing, as he must, that she was astray
in the mountains, he would spare no pains in order to make
his words good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you know him, too; but never mind now. We
must not converse any more. See! the devils are in sight,
down yonder by the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously peering through the leafy screen before them
the three fugitives could just distinguish the faint, shadowy
outlines of a number of horsemen, down in the valley. These
soon crossed the creek, and then one being left in charge of
the horses, the rest&mdash;six in number&mdash;dismounted and began
quartering over the ground, like hounds searching for a lost
scent.</p>
<p>The soldier tightly compressed his lips, and grasped his
rifle with deadly determination. He saw that the enemy had
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
evidently divined the manner in which their anticipated victim
had escaped them&mdash;at least in part&mdash;and believed she
was still hiding in some place in the vicinity.</p>
<p>It was not probable they were aware of the presence of
other foes in the neighborhood, else they would have displayed
more caution. Evidently they believed Clara had
abandoned her failing horse, and sought safety by lying in
concealment.</p>
<p>The moonlight was too faint and uncertain for the savages
to learn aught from a trail upon the rocky ground, and that
fact was in favor of the fugitives. Still, there could be no
denying that they were in imminent peril of their lives.</p>
<p>The Arapahoes scattered and began a close and systematic
search of the ground, peering behind each bowlder, into every
bush and cranny where a human form might possibly have
sought refuge. The six were widely scattered, the better to
compass their purpose.</p>
<p>Upon the movements of one of the savages in particular,
was the attention of the three friends riveted. He alone of
the party was in close proximity to the hidden prey.</p>
<p>He was a large, brawny warrior, and was now gliding
along the hill-side, gradually approaching the covert of our
friends, carefully scrutinizing every yard of ground as he
proceeded. Presently he paused and glanced keenly around
him. Then his piercing gaze rested fairly upon the line of
bushes that screened the base of the cliff.</p>
<p>His tall, muscular frame, drawn rigidly erect, in all the
pride of war-paint and plumes, looked grandly terrible in the
glimmering moonlight, and even the eyes of Delaware Tom
emitted a momentary gleam of admiration as they dwelt upon
the perfect figure. But then this gave place to a glare of
deadly hatred as if he recognized a bitter personal enemy in
the warrior.</p>
<p>The Arapahoe stood thus for a moment, and then began
gliding up the hill-side, his eyes seeming to pierce through
and through the screen, so keen was their glance. He saw
that this was a good cover, and believed or hoped that the
fugitive had taken refuge there.</p>
<p>Travers crouched down and drew his revolver, with a
stern demeanor, but then a light touch upon his shoulder
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
caused him to turn his head. The Delaware made a peculiar
gesture, and then hissed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shoot&mdash;mek too much noise. Let Delaware tek him.
Know um&mdash;he kisch-kouch&mdash;big t&rsquo;ief&mdash;me kill him heap sure.
Tom&rsquo;hawk mek no noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Tom, I forgot,&rdquo; muttered Travers, below
his breath; and then fearing to say more, they watched the
red-skin&rsquo;s progress in perfect silence.</p>
<p>The Arapahoe did not pause, but kept on until he could
touch the bushes with his outstretched hand. Evidently he
did not dream of danger to himself, for he believed the fugitive
maiden was alone.</p>
<p>Then he reached out and parted the bushes. This he did
at a point some yards to the left of where the trio were concealed,
and a grunt of disappointment broke from his lips, as
he discovered nothing but bare rocks.</p>
<p>Then he moved nearer, parting the bushes at each step,
steadily nearing those which concealed the three friends.
His hand rested upon them, and then they were gently pressed
aside.</p>
<p>The Delaware was prepared for this move, and as the
moonlight shot into the aperture his uplifted hand fell, clutching
the heavy tomahawk, whose keen edge alighted fairly
upon the bowed crest of the savage. The blow was delivered
with a sure aim, and was deadly in its effects.</p>
<p>But as the left hand of Delaware Tom shot out to clutch
the throat of the Arapahoe, to check any outcry, the stricken
savage bounded back and uttered his thrilling death-cry.
This was done so quickly that it could not be prevented.</p>
<p>But then, ere the lifeless body could touch the ground, it
was seized by the Delaware and pushed into the bushes.
Then, for a moment, all was still.</p>
<p>Only for a moment, however, for then the comrades of the
slaughtered brave took up the yell, and echoed it long and
loud, as they intuitively drew together, in wondering alarm.
They well knew it was a cry from death-stricken lips, but
what had caused it, or from what direction it had come, they
knew not.</p>
<p>The cry had echoed through the hills, sounding from several
different points, and no two of the party could agree upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
which one was the right. A glance told them that one of
their number was missing&mdash;the best and bravest warrior
among them all.</p>
<p>They were within fair view of the spot where the brave
had met his death, although, of course, ignorant of that fact,
and had the fugitives deemed it prudent, they could easily
have sent a brace of rifle-bullets into the little crowd. But,
as long as the savages did not molest them, Travers was willing
to do likewise, now that a helpless woman was under his
protection.</p>
<p>Though he did not greatly fear the result of a collision
with the six, he did not deem it prudent to invite such, under
the circumstances. A random shot might work incalculable
harm.</p>
<p>Clara shuddered convulsively as a peculiar sound met her
ear, from where Delaware Tom was crouched. She knew
he was scalping the dead brave, although she could not see
the action, as the thick-matted screen of bushes effectually
shut out the light of the moon.</p>
<p>With a grunt of satisfaction, Delaware Tom affixed the
reeking trophy to his girdle, and then turned toward the soldier.
Side by side, they peered out upon their foes in the
valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big fools plenty skeered,&rdquo; chuckled Tom, as he noted the
irresolute air of the enemy. &ldquo;Little more mek &rsquo;um run like
de debble. S&rsquo;pose shoot one, two time, dey run way off.
Git scalp, too. Kin hit &rsquo;um from dis,&rdquo; he added, eagerly fingering
his rifle as though longing to begin the affray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tom, you mustn&rsquo;t do it. It would not be safe.
Were we alone, I wouldn&rsquo;t care how soon you began it, but
now we have another to look out for, besides ourselves. <i>She</i>
might get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Delaware did not reply, but he was evidently dissatisfied.
He had tasted blood, and it had aroused all the worst
passions of his half-tamed nature.</p>
<p>The savages appeared to be undecided as to the course best
for them to pursue, and for several minutes conversed earnestly
together, closely watched by their hidden foes. But
then there was a decided move on the part of the former.</p>
<p>One of their number moved toward the horses, and, mounting,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
rode rapidly off up the valley, soon disappearing from
view.</p>
<p>Travers and Toni exchanged glances. Right well they divined
the meaning of this move, and it evidently caused
them not a little uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone after help,&rdquo; muttered the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh. Dat&rsquo;s it. S&rsquo;pose we stay here, den dey ketch us
all, same like buff&rsquo;lo. S&rsquo;pose we don&rsquo;t like dat, den we mus&rsquo;
git &rsquo;way, &rsquo;fore dey gits back ag&rsquo;in. Dat right, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we must make a move. Surely we can manage
those fellows, yonder. If we do, and can catch some of the
horses, we can ride back to camp to-night. But how shall
we do it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop&mdash;me t&rsquo;ink a little. Plenty time&mdash;no hurry,&rdquo; and
then the Delaware appeared deep-buried in thought.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />TOM MAXWELL TURNS INDIAN.</h2>
<p>Major Calhoun and Tom Maxwell &ldquo;listened with all
their ears,&rdquo; for a sound they fervently hoped would never
come&mdash;the wild yells of exultation, telling that their messenger
had been captured by the Indians, and the dissipation of
their last hope.</p>
<p>And thus they remained for several minutes, without a
sound to greet their hearing, save the usual ones of the night.
But then, just as they were congratulating themselves upon
the complete success of the venture, their blood was fairly
curdled and their hearts wrung by a startling alarm.</p>
<p>From some distance came the noise, then arose a wild tumult
and outcry, as of human voices, the owners of which
were engaged in a bitter struggle for life and death. And
then from the prairie around the beleaguered train, there
sounded the shrill cries and signals of the aroused warriors,
followed by the rapid tread of several horses in full gallop,
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
all tending toward the point below, where had first sounded
the alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! Tom, the boy is lost!&rdquo; groaned Calhoun,
agonizedly, as he sunk back and covered his face with his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feared he is, boss, but look up. Don&rsquo;t give way now,
jest when we need our wits the wust. What&rsquo;s did is did, an&rsquo;
cain&rsquo;t be ondid, nuther. Think o&rsquo; the rest&mdash;o&rsquo; Miss Clary&mdash;an&rsquo;
&rsquo;member ef we go under, so&rsquo;ll she, &rsquo;thout a doubt. Ha!
look&mdash;they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he added, suddenly, as several figures
appeared in view upon the prairie beyond. &ldquo;Look out, boys&mdash;gi&rsquo;
the pesky imps a lettle thunder, jest to let &rsquo;em know
what they&rsquo;ve got to ixpect herea&rsquo;ter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he yelled these words, Maxwell discharged his rifle at
a prominent Indian, who suddenly paused in his onward career,
tottered for a moment, then fell heavily forward upon
his face. And along the line of smoke-begrimed wagons
there was another flash, like those which had preceded it,
with a like deadly effect.</p>
<p>But the one volley was all that was needed, for then the
savages appeared to melt away and disappear from view.
This had evidently been no concerted assault, but the red-skins
had rushed forward, alarmed by the tumult below, no doubt
fearing their intended prey were attempting to escape by way
of the river.</p>
<p>When the temporary confusion had in a measure subsided,
the two men listened anxiously for some sound from below, to
tell them of the probable fate of their messenger, but all was
still. The event had evidently decided, in one way or another,
during the brief assault.</p>
<p>And they naturally dreaded the worst. The first yells told
them that Buenos Ayres had been discovered, and had been
engaged in a death-struggle with the enemy. He could
scarcely have escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are indeed lost,&rdquo; bitterly uttered Calhoun, to the
old guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks dub&rsquo;ous&mdash;durned dub&rsquo;ous, I must say. But then
mebbe &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t so bad as it looks. We may fool &rsquo;em yit. It&rsquo;s
my turn, now,&rdquo; added Tom, with a sudden increase of confidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? you would not be foolish enough to attempt that?
They will be watching the river so close after this that a fish
could scarcely pass their lines. It would be suicide, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest so; ef I tried it&mdash;which I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;tend doin&rsquo;. No sir,
I ain&rsquo;t sech a fool&mdash;<i>yit!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you intend doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walkin&rsquo; out thar an&rsquo; j&rsquo;inin&rsquo; them imps,&rdquo; coolly returned
Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time for fooling, Tom. Our situation is far
too serious to admit of that. Such a move would be even
worse than the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. Anyhow, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to try it. They cain&rsquo;t
do much more&rsquo;n kill a feller, anyhow, an&rsquo; ef we stay here
they&rsquo;re bound to do it, shore. So what matter? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;
out thar, an&rsquo; they hain&rsquo;t a-goin to hurt me, nuther,&rdquo; confidently
added the scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Calhoun, seeing
that his companion was undoubtedly in earnest in what he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to turn Injun fer a bit, jest to see how that pesky
Dusky Dick must feel. But don&rsquo;t talk. Watch the perayrie
cluss&mdash;watch fer both on us, fer I cain&rsquo;t do my shar&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old scout left the side of the puzzled soldier, and glided
toward a pile of dead savages, who had been carelessly
heaped together, after the second assault, so as to clear the
way. These comprised all those who had fallen inside the
corral.</p>
<p>As he rudely turned these over with his foot, Tom uttered
a grunt of approval, and then catching one of the dead braves
by the arm, he dragged it to the spot where crouched Calhoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with that, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to skin it, fust. Then putt on the hide an&rsquo; walk
out yender an&rsquo; tell those imps as how I was dead, but hev
come to life ag&rsquo;in,&rdquo; chuckled the old guide.</p>
<p>Calhoun uttered an exclamation of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t git huffy, now, boss, &rsquo;cause I speak sorter mixed-up
like. You know my way, or had orter by this time. But
lis&rsquo;en an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. You see this &rsquo;ere carr&rsquo;on
is&mdash;or was, I&rsquo;d orter say, mebbe,
seein&rsquo; as he&rsquo;s dead&mdash;a Delaware
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
Injun. That proves what I said &rsquo;bout Dusky Dick&rsquo;s
hevin&rsquo; picked up a band of runnygades to do his dirty work,
fer thar is &rsquo;Rapahoe, Cheyenne, Pawnee, an&rsquo; Delaware &rsquo;mongst
them dead critters over yon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I kin jabber a lettle o&rsquo; most all o&rsquo; them, but better
Delaware, fer as you may know, I hed one&mdash;Delaware Tom
they called the cuss&mdash;fer a pardner, well-nigh two years. So
as the lad&mdash;<i>durn</i> the luck!&mdash;hes got rub&mdash;inter trouble I
mean, an&rsquo; cain&rsquo;t go fer help, why I &rsquo;termined to try an&rsquo; sneak
through them imps thar. I knowed thar was no use tryin&rsquo; to
play the runnygade as he did, fer the imps&rsquo;ll be on the keen
look-out thar, an&rsquo; this was the only chaince. An&rsquo; a durned
slim one, too, but better&rsquo;n stayin&rsquo; here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try, but I fear &rsquo;tis a hopeless case. If they make
another steady rush, we must go down before it. If we do,
and you get free, Tom, promise me one thing: that you&rsquo;ll
not forget Clara? You&rsquo;ll hunt for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, nuther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest so. Give a fool answer fer a fool question, is my
motter, al&rsquo;ays. Ain&rsquo;t I a man&mdash;a <i>white</i> man, too, ef so be you
rub a lettle o&rsquo; the outside dirt off? Then in <i>course</i> I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;I
ain&rsquo;t a dog nor nothin&rsquo;, I reckon. But don&rsquo;t fret.
We&rsquo;ll all hunt together. I&rsquo;ll git you free. See ef I don&rsquo;t,
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the old guide glided toward the river, accompanied
by Calhoun. But as he hung his legs over the
edge of the bank, Maxwell suddenly added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here&mdash;ef you see or hear a feller shoot this-a-way,
from out thar, nigh to the river, don&rsquo;t you shoot back, onless
you aim at that big star, yonder. Mought hurt somebody, ef
you did. He&rsquo;s a powerful poor shooter, that fellow&rsquo;ll be,
when he minds to. Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder ef he&rsquo;ll miss the hull
intire train, wagons an&rsquo; all,&rdquo; chuckled Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ll fire from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas. Must throw dust in the red-skins&rsquo; eyes, ye see, or
else they&rsquo;ll some on &rsquo;em be snoopin&rsquo; &rsquo;round to see who I be,
which moughtn&rsquo;t be pleasant. Ef they see me a-shootin&rsquo; this-a-way,
they&rsquo;ll natur&rsquo;lly s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; themselves, slid out to
play a lone hand. See?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then keep my rifle. I cain&rsquo;t han&rsquo;le it the way I must
go; &rsquo;volvers must sarve me. But don&rsquo;t let nobody tetch it.
I&rsquo;d be plum lost ef any thin&rsquo; was to happin to it; I would
<i>so</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Maxwell slid down into the water, that here was but
little over knee-deep, and crouching low down he glided rapidly
up the river, bound upon a mission that could scarcely
succeed, now that the enemy had their eyes opened by a somewhat
similar attempt. And once more Calhoun went back
to his post, with a heavy gloom resting upon his heart.</p>
<p>Tom stealthily pursued his way up-stream until he was
fully a hundred yards above the corral, when he gained the
spot for which he had aimed. This was a little depression
that ran from the water&rsquo;s edge, some few yards into the level
prairie.</p>
<p>Here he hesitated for a moment. He glanced along in
the direction he had been pursuing, and debated earnestly in
his own mind whether it would not be better for him to keep
on, and by thus rounding the hill, avoid a probable meeting
with those beleaguering the corral.</p>
<p>But this hesitation lasted only for a moment. He saw that
the contemplated change was now impossible. That the savages
had guarded against any such attempt upon the part of
their intended victims.</p>
<p>His keen eye caught sight of several dusky figures that
he felt assured were none other than Indians, who had been
detailed to guard the stream above. And this was not all.</p>
<p>He also saw enough of their movements to tell that he was
discovered; that his progress had not been so cautiously made
as to escape the prying eyes of his enemies. A quiver agitated
his frame, and for a moment his heart was sick within
him.</p>
<p>Not with personal fear, however. There could scarcely be
found one who was more utterly reckless of his own life than
this same guide. For nearly two score years he had lived with
his life in his hand. At dawn he knew not whether he
would ever again look upon the setting sun.</p>
<p>And all this had rendered him utterly reckless and devoid
of fear, so far as he was concerned alone. But now he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
others to think of and work for. Upon the success of this
venture probably hung the lives of the entire company of
emigrants. Were he slain or captured, he believed that ere
the sun arose all would be over; that his friends would be
swept from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>For a moment he half resolved to spring to his feet and
dash swiftly away over the plain, trusting to his great endurance
and fleetness of foot to escape. But then this idea was as
quickly discarded.</p>
<p>He knew that such an action would but too surely betray
his identity, and that a cry would be raised and immediate
pursuit instituted. Pursuit, too, upon horseback; fleet
though he undeniably was, and long of wind, he could not
hope to cope successfully with the fiery, half-wild mustangs,
especially when bestrode by those rare jockeys, the Prairie
Indians.</p>
<p>Maxwell resolved upon a bold course of action; or rather
fell back upon the old plan. Its success mainly depended
upon one thing.</p>
<p>How long had the red-skins been watching him? Had
they observed his leaving the interior of the corral? If so,
then his fate was indubitably sealed.</p>
<p>But had they only noted him recently&mdash;as he hoped; for
he had been careful to keep low down within the dense shadow
of the bank of the river, where the moon&rsquo;s rays could
not reach him&mdash;he thought he might yet succeed in deceiving
them. And upon this hope he acted.</p>
<p>With one glance behind him, at the dim, phantom-like
figures that were still stealthily approaching him, Maxwell
emerged from the hollow, upon the side toward the corral,
and, upon his hands and knees, began crawling quite rapidly
toward the wagon-train. Then he dropped down quite flat
upon his face, casting a glance behind him as he did so.</p>
<p>The red-skins in pursuit had just crossed the ditch, and
were crawling after him. They had gained rapidly in the
last few minutes, and their dress, as well as weapons, could
now quite plainly be seen.</p>
<p>Then Tom leveled his revolver toward the corral, taking
care to aim above it, so that the bullet could by no possibility
inflict harm upon any of his friends, he fired. Almost like
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
an echo, there came a return shot from the train, and Tom
fairly chuckled with delight.</p>
<p>This was just what he had hoped for, though he feared
Calhoun would not risk a shot, knowing the circumstances, at
least in part. But now, nothing could be better calculated to
allay any suspicions the red-skins behind him might have entertained.</p>
<p>Tom glanced backward, beneath one arm. To his delight,
he saw that the Indians had paused, and were now closely
hugging the ground, evidently trying to lessen the mark their
bodies presented, lest a bullet from the corral should bury itself
beneath their precious hides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef that much works so well, reckon I&rsquo;ll go a leetle furder
&rsquo;th it, though it &rsquo;d jist be partic&rsquo;lar ge-mineezers ef some o&rsquo; the
boys should shoot me fer a red. But I reckon the boss &rsquo;ll
look out fer that. Anyhow, I must shake off them pesky
imps. Let ary one o&rsquo; them git a glimpse o&rsquo; my mug, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll
be all night &rsquo;th <i>this</i> coon, shore!&rdquo; muttered the old guide, as
he gradually worked himself still nearer the corral.</p>
<p>This move, though not a little hazardous to himself, had the
desired effect, and as he once more glanced back, Tom saw
that his red-skinned followers had retreated, and were hidden
from view. He now fired again, and while reloading the
empty chambers, he busied himself by peering keenly around
him, to discover, if possible, some point through which he
could pass with the least delay, and consequently peril, to himself
and important mission.</p>
<p>He dared not dally long, for the night was rolling on apace,
and he must be miles away from this spot ere the sun arose
above the eastern hill-tops. Then, with sternly-compressed
lips and finely-strung nerves, he started anew upon his errand.</p>
<p>He turned, and still crouching far down, with head bowed
so that the dried grass was blended with his hair and long
beard, completely hiding his features, he glided slowly away
from the corral, shaping his course so as to carry himself to
one side of the main body of Indians, as he calculated.</p>
<p>Already a chuckle of delight was tickling his throat, as he
saw how finely he was progressing, for he believed that his
<i>ruse</i> would succeed, when an incident occurred which changed
his exultation to angry apprehension.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>From a dense mass of dried grass, almost directly in his
path, there uprose the figure of a stalwart savage, who had
doubtless been observing the scout&rsquo;s movements. He was now
so close that Maxwell could not avoid him without exciting
suspicion, which would bring with it investigation and consequent
discovery.</p>
<p>So he kept on in his course, that would carry him a few
feet to one side of the Indian. But the other did not seem
disposed to allow his seeming ally and brother to pass by unquestioned.</p>
<p>He spoke in a harsh voice that also expressed suspicion.
The words were uttered in the Arapahoe dialect, with which
Tom was sufficiently conversant to comprehend their purport.
But he well knew that this knowledge was not perfect enough
to carry him through a conversation with a native undetected,
and so he replied in Delaware:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wounded. The accursed pale-faces saw me as I
crept up out yonder to try and kill them, and shot me. The
bullet made me sick,&rdquo; he said, in a husky tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo; demanded the other, also using
the dialect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hunting the medicine-grass,&rdquo; added Tom, fearing to
lose any more time, and again crawling forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Let me see your hurt. I may stop the blood, and
then I will find the grass for you,&rdquo; added the Arapahoe, in a
kind voice, evidently swallowing the lie, and feeling no further
suspicion concerning the identity of his seeming ally.</p>
<p>And, then, in the kindness of his heart, he strode forward
and placed his hand upon the disguised scout&rsquo;s head. The
act was a fatal one; the fastenings of the grass head-dress
became unloosened, and the mass came off in the Indian&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>A wild cry broke from the red-skin&rsquo;s lips, as the bright
moonlight fell fully upon the features of the guide. There
could be no possibility of mistaking them for other than those
of a white man.</p>
<p>But that cry was his last upon earth; for, with an angry
howl of furious rage, Tom Maxwell sprung erect, and grappled
with his foe. His powerful arms bore the savage to the
ground like an infant, while his hands were clasped tightly
around his throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>As they fell heavily to the ground, the warrior appeared to
recover from his surprise, and struggled desperately for dear
life. His arms were wound around the scout&rsquo;s body with
crushing pressure, and he writhed like a wounded snake in the
endeavor to turn his foe.</p>
<p>Tom dared not relax his grasp upon the throat of the Arapahoe,
lest he should cry out and give the alarm, to bring an
overwhelming force upon him; then his fate would be assuredly
sealed. And thus he could only try to throttle his enemy
in time to flee from the spot before any other should be
alarmed by the struggle.</p>
<p>For several seconds this continued; but then, to his horror,
Tom heard a wild cry, and then the rapid rush of many feet,
plainly coming toward him. He knew that the savages were
alarmed, and had caught sight of the struggling foemen.</p>
<p>With a howl of rage, he freed one hand, and drew his
knife. Then it glowed for a brief instant in the bright moonlight
before falling with a heavy <i>thud</i>, sinking to its very haft
in the broad chest of the Indian.</p>
<p>But still, even in the throes of death, those muscular arms
held him firmly, despite Maxwell&rsquo;s efforts to break the grip.
With a desperate effort, Tom sprung to his feet, lifting with
him the dead man, whose horribly-convulsed features stared
him full in the face.</p>
<p>Then, with a fierce curse, Tom wrenched free, and made a
step forward as if to flee. But he was too late.</p>
<p>The enemy were upon him, and the tall scout was cast
heavily to the ground, with a dozen hands clutching him.
A brief, furious struggle, and the savages arose, while the
counterfeit Indian lay beside the body of his dead foe, a helpless
captive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />A TANGLED TRAIL.</h2>
<p>Buenos Ayres had not overestimated the danger and peril
that would attend his effort to pass by the vigilant red-skin,
on his journey toward the Main Trail, in quest of help for the
beleaguered emigrants.</p>
<p>And then, under the circumstances, he was about the last
person who should have been chosen as the forlorn hope, although
he was undeniably brave, and usually, keen-witted
and far-seeing. But now these latter qualities were in a
measure overpowered by the anxiety he felt to perform his
mission with the least delay possible, in order that a thorough
and systematic search might be made for the missing maiden,
Clara Calhoun, and, to this desire, he sacrificed prudence and
caution to a degree nearly fatal.</p>
<p>He swam rapidly down-stream, though the water was not
waist-deep, but, in this manner he could proceed more silently
than by wading. He lay low down in the water, that
he might present a less fair mark for prying eyes to rest upon,
and, hidden in the shadow, he believed that he could succeed
in passing the lines of the enemy, unseen.</p>
<p>In this manner he had gained the edge of the timber, before-mentioned,
that extended nearly to the verge of the river-bank.
But then he suddenly paused in his advance.</p>
<p>Before him lay something dark, evidently resting in or
upon the water, and at only a few yards&rsquo; distance. For a
moment Buenos believed that this was the head of a man,
whose body&mdash;like his own&mdash;was covered in the water.</p>
<p>But then a movement on the part of the object undeceived
him. It slowly swung around, as though under the influence
of the feeble current, and he could see that it was a log; evidently
one of those upon which the savages had descended
the river, in order to gain and attack the rear of the emigrants.</p>
<p>With a low laugh at his unnecessary fright, Ayres advanced,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
swimming rapidly, intending to use the log in his further
progress. But he speedily saw that this action had been
made too quickly for his own safety.</p>
<p>His keen eyes detected a suspicious circumstance connected
with the log, and he instantly paused. From the further side
of the stick he beheld an object that had escaped his eyes before,
or else had recently made its appearance there.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a roundish knob or protuberance upon
the side of the log. True, this might possibly have been beneath
the water until then, and was only revealed by the rolling
of the log, but Ayres felt confident that the <i>log had not
rolled</i>. He could tell that from the quiet water.</p>
<p>Then it must be&mdash; So far he had reasoned, but then, quick
as thought, he ducked his head beneath the water.</p>
<p>A sudden movement beside the log had caused this. He
beheld the round object raise still higher, and then with an
abrupt movement a dark tube was whirled around from the
top of the log, until its muzzle pointed toward the young adventurer&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>The knob was the head of a savage&mdash;the tube was a rifle,
and Ayres knew that he was discovered. All this flashed
athwart his mind like a revelation of light, and, as he dove
beneath the surface, his plan of procedure was fully determined
upon.</p>
<p>He must dispose of this enemy or die. The alarm once
given, escape would be almost impossible, and with his capture,
the hopes of the emigrants would be crushed.</p>
<p>Then he must silence this foe before he could fire his rifle
or give the alarm otherwise. But could he do it? That
was doubtful; still, as a last hope, he resolved to attempt the
feat.</p>
<p>As he sunk beneath the surface, Buenos drew his knife,
and then swam with swift, strong strokes toward the spot
where he knew the Indian must be crouching. And his calculations
proved correct.</p>
<p>His head struck violently against the half-submerged log,
and springing up he dashed the water from his blinded
eyes.</p>
<p>The savage was taken by surprise, and evidently had not
expected such a bold move. Quite likely he had been in
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
doubt whether the advancing figure was that of an enemy or
a friend, as the small bundle fastened upon Ayres&rsquo; head, added
to the gloom, rendered it impossible for a glimpse to be obtained
of his features. His action in throwing forward his
rifle-muzzle, had simply been one of prudence, in case it was
really an enemy who approached.</p>
<p>Then when the young man sprung up so suddenly before
him, the log being driven against his body with considerable
violence, the savage gave vent to a grunt of mingled surprise
and bewilderment. But from this he quickly recovered.</p>
<p>Buenos&mdash;his first thought being to prevent an alarm&mdash;seized
upon the rifle-barrel, and with an adroit movement,
wrenched it from the grasp of his foe, with the same gesture
casting it out into deep water. Then his left hand shot out
and clutched the throat of the red-skin with a grip strengthened
by the great interests at stake.</p>
<p>But the Indian was a brawny fellow, and as he grappled
fiercely with his foeman, he freed his throat sufficiently to
emit, loud and clear, the thrilling war-whoop of his tribe.
With a curse of bitter vexation, Ayres wrenched his right
arm free, and then dealt the savage a swift, vicious blow with
the heavy knife.</p>
<p>It penetrated deep, but the wound was not mortal. Once
more the shrill yell resounded through the air, awaking
echoes far and wide; once again the crimsoned steel rose and
fell, with a dull, sickening <i>thud</i>.</p>
<p>With a wild shriek of mortal agony, the death-stricken
savage sunk backward, but still his bony fingers clutched the
white man with a grip nerved by death. And from the
prairie beyond, Ayres could hear the shrill cries of the alarmed
red-skins, and then the rapid thud of horses&rsquo; hoofs approaching
the spot at a full gallop.</p>
<p>Then he plunged over the log, head-foremost, and sunk
in the water. This action freed him from the dead Indian,
and then arising to the surface, Buenos swam for dear life,
down-stream.</p>
<p>But he knew that did he continue on in this course, he
must be discovered by the rapidly approaching red-skins, and
so he turned toward the bank, half resolved to enter the timber
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
and seek safety in flight by land. In this, however, he was
disappointed.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he touched shore, when his quick eye detected
several dusky figures upon the bank, near the spot where he
had slain the Indian. He knew they were the dead man&rsquo;s
comrades; one glance told him that.</p>
<p>And the same glance also showed him the form of the
dead Indian, his face, horribly distorted with the last agony,
upturned toward the star-studded vault of heaven, slowly
floating down with the stream, nearing its slayer, with each
passing moment. Then there uprose a wild cry from those
upon the shore, telling that they, also, had discovered the
slain man.</p>
<p>It now seemed as though the fate of the young man was
indubitably sealed. Escape from being discovered seemed
impossible, and to be captured now, with that terribly significant
witness of his deeds lying there before the eyes of all,
meant <i>death</i>.</p>
<p>Several heavy splashes were heard, and Ayres saw that
while some ran along the bank toward him, others had entered
the water, to drag forth their dead comrade. And
now the corpse was within a few yards of where he crouched,
while almost directly over his head he could hear the heavy
tramp of other foes.</p>
<p>Ayres shrunk back against the bank, where the water was
still several feet deep. He clutched his knife with desperation,
resolved to sell his life dearly, should he be discovered.
But then his heart thrilled with a gleam of joy.</p>
<p>In the bank beside him was a small hole or depression,
that had evidently been washed out by the action of the water.
Instantly one hand was extended to ascertain its size.</p>
<p>It only reached a few inches above the surface, and was
over a foot in depth, running back into the bank. Below, it
was still larger, and Ayres believed that by its aid he could
still escape his foes.</p>
<p>All this occurred in a breath of time, and the water was
still agitated by the heavy plunges, when Buenos glided back
and into the fortunately discovered refuge. By crouching
almost double, he managed to stow his body away in the hole,
with his legs doubled beneath his body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>A quick gesture daubed his face with the soft black mud,
and then Buenos awaited the result in painful surprise. For
not only did his own life depend upon it, but, in all probability,
those of his friends in the besieged corral, as well.</p>
<p>His head was drawn back into the hole, so that his nose
was barely above water, and his face beyond the surface of
the bank. The mud had rendered his features the color of
the dirt surrounding, and only by touching him, could the
savages have discovered the difference.</p>
<p>Through his half-closed lids, Buenos watched the movements
of the savages, now almost directly opposite him. A
shower of dirt rolled down from above, telling that those he
had noticed on shore were still near at hand.</p>
<p>Then a new and startling sound came to the ears of the
young adventurer. He heard the shrill yells&mdash;the wild outcry&mdash;the
rattling of rifles, all telling of another deadly assault
upon the wagon-train.</p>
<p>The savages in the water paused as if startled, and then
hastily grasping the body of their dead comrade, they swam
rapidly ashore with it, landing just below where crouched
the young man. Words passed between them and the others,
the purport of which Ayres could only guess, owing to his
complete ignorance of the dialect.</p>
<p>Then the corpse was handed up the bank, and shortly afterward
Buenos heard the quick trampling of feet, as a number
of Indians dashed away toward the train. He believed they
were all gone, and made a movement as though he would
have left his covert, in order to continue his journey, without
any more loss of time.</p>
<p>But fortunately for him, Ayres recognized the folly of such
precipitation, before it was too late. From almost directly
above him, he heard the low sound of voices, and knew by
it that his enemies had not yet given up the search for the
slayer of their friend.</p>
<p>With wildly beating heart Buenos listened to the progress
of the struggle above; but it speedily died away, and then
all was still. The absence of the red-skins&rsquo; yells of triumph,
told Ayres that his friends had successfully repulsed the onset,
and his heart lightened considerably.</p>
<p>Had he only been at liberty to resume his journey, all might
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
yet be well. But though he could no longer hear the sound
of voices, Ayres felt assured that the red-skins were still upon
the watch.</p>
<p>They must know that an enemy had stricken them a bitter
blow near that spot, and would reason that he could not have
gotten far away, before their arrival. That he was still hidden
somewhere in close proximity to the spot of death.</p>
<p>As time passed by, Buenos began to grow still more uneasy.
Every moment was valuable now, and he should even
then be miles away upon his important mission.</p>
<p>But what if these savages should keep up the watch until
day dawned? Then they would assuredly unearth him.</p>
<p>Not only would he be doomed, in such a case, but the last
hope of the besieged emigrants would be dashed to the ground.
Unassisted, they must soon succumb to the overpowering force
of the red-skins.</p>
<p>A desperate resolve began to shape itself in the mind of
our young adventurer. He would dare all, and emerge from
his covert. It could be but death, at the most, and that risk
he would rather run, than longer endure this horrible, agonizing
suspense.</p>
<p>Still he could hear no sound of his enemies, and as the moments
passed on, Ayres made the desperate move. Were the
Indians still lying in wait for some such movement on the
part of their unknown enemy, he knew that he was lost.</p>
<p>They could scarcely fail to hear him, or discover his motions.
The line of shadow was fearfully narrowed, and at
but a short distance ahead, where the belt of timber came to
an end, the bright moonlight revealed every inch of the water&rsquo;s
surface.</p>
<p>Just as he had straightened out his limbs, preparatory to
emerging from his uncomfortable hiding-place, Ayres paused.
Another alarm rung out upon the air, from beyond the wagon-train.</p>
<p>Then came a single shrill war-whoop, that he had so often
listened to on that eventful night, followed by wild shouts from
the Indians, telling of some important discovery. And then,
from almost directly above his head, there sounded a guttural
exclamation, closely followed by the tramp of human feet.</p>
<p>Ayres shuddered convulsively as he realized the extent of
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
the peril he had so nearly brought upon himself, by his rash
action. He knew now that the red-skins had indeed been
lying in wait for him, and only for this strange diversion,
would inevitably have made the desired discovery.</p>
<p>Though sadly puzzled to account for the outcry&mdash;for Ayres
well knew that the latter cries were those of exultation&mdash;the
young man dared not dally longer, but slipping forth from
his hiding-place, he swam rapidly down-stream for a few
yards, until near the end of the timber-belt furthest from the
corral.</p>
<p>Then he cautiously scaled the bank, and entered the dense
undergrowth. Pausing, he hearkened intently.</p>
<p>All was still in his immediate vicinity, although from near
the wagon-train he could hear an occasional rifle-shot, telling
that his friends were still upon the alert. And then he glided
stealthily forward until at the edge of the prairie.</p>
<p>Cautiously peering forth upon the vast, level expanse thus
spread before him, Buenos saw with delight that as far as his
eye could reach, there was not a single living form to be
seen. The road appeared open before him, and he was about
to enter upon it, when a sudden recollection caused him to
pause.</p>
<p>The revolver was still strapped upon his head, according
to the advice given him by Tom Maxwell, but it was far
from being in a condition fit for use. The sudden dive, on
seeing the savage beside the log, added to several immersions
since, had pretty thoroughly saturated it.</p>
<p>Not knowing at what moment he might be called upon to
make use of this, in order to preserve his life, Ayres&rsquo; first
move was to draw the bullets, and wiping the chambers dry,
he carefully reloaded them. Then fitting on the water-proof
caps, he replaced it in his belt, and once more stepped forth
upon the prairie.</p>
<p>Had he not already lost so much time, Buenos would probably
have exercised more precaution than he was now using.
But, racked with anxiety and the dread of being too late to
aid his comrades in peril, rendered him half wild.</p>
<p>Crouching low down, he ran at a rapid pace out over the
level prairie, in the direction he must follow in order to strike
the Main Trail, which they had so unfortunately&mdash;as it
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
proved&mdash;deviated from, a couple of days previously. The
moon still shone brightly, and there was great danger of his
being discovered by some of the lynx-eyed savages, who surrounded
the wagon-train.</p>
<p>But this, Ayres resolved to risk, rather than lose any more
time, although he knew that, in case he should be seen, there
could be but one ending to the affair.</p>
<p>Fortunately for him, perhaps the suspicions of the red-skins
had been lulled by the recent capture of Tom Maxwell, for
they believed him to be the one who had slain their brother
below the corral, as well as the one beside whose body he
had been captured. Thus they did not dream of another foeman
being at liberty so near them.</p>
<p>As Ayres glanced back over his shoulder, a shudder crept
over his frame, for he now realized the full extent of the
great peril he was daring. Behind him he could quite plainly
distinguish the dark corral, and still nearer, the numerous
figures, dusky and phantom-like, moving restlessly hither and
yon, that he knew were none other than savages.</p>
<p>It seemed as though they could not fail of seeing him, and
as he once more sped on at an accelerated speed, Buenos listened
with painful intentness, expecting each moment to hear
the shrill war-cry peal forth, telling that the bloodthirsty demons
were upon his trail.</p>
<p>But then he crossed the slight rise, and the fear-inspiring
sight was hidden from his view. Then breathing more freely,
he took the pole-star for his guide, and dashed on at break-neck
speed, every nerve strained to its utmost tension, and
his heart wildly throbbing with renewed hope of success.</p>
<p>For well-nigh an hour he maintained this killing pace, but
then Nature forced him to slacken his gait, and proceed with
more prudence. His eyes were roving upon every side of
him, trying to recall some landmark, though he well knew he
was yet far from the Main Trail&mdash;the object of his quest.</p>
<p>He crossed a slight swell and trotted down the opposite
slope, into a sort of valley, if it may be called such. Then
he began ascending the next rise.</p>
<p>Suddenly he paused. A suspicious sound saluted his hearing;
the <i>thud</i>&mdash;<i>thud</i>&mdash;of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs beating upon the
hard turf in a full gallop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>And this, too, he soon found was approaching him, for the
trampling grew louder and more distinct. But it was not
coming from the direction of the corral, though this was
Ayres&rsquo; first thought. Instead it was coming from directly in
his front.</p>
<p>Buenos glanced hurriedly around for some cover within
which to ensconce himself, but no such sight rewarded
his search. There was not a bush or bunch of grass to be
seen, within reach.</p>
<p>And at that moment the figure of a horse and rider loomed
up, clear and distinct, upon the ridge, almost directly before
the young man. As by an impulse, Buenos dropped flat
to the ground, and drew his revolver, ready for use in case he
was discovered.</p>
<p>Then the horseman came thundering on, seemingly about
to ride directly over the prostrate form. A collision appeared
inevitable, and Buenos, with tightly-compressed lips, cocked
his pistol.</p>
<p>On thundered the horse, and was within a score of yards
of the young man, when, with a wild snort, it turned to one
side, then dashed on with accelerated speed, in its passage
flinging a tiny shower of dust and sand over Ayres. A hoarse
cry broke from the lips of its rider, as he swayed in his seat,
but he did not appear to notice the cause of his animal&rsquo;s affright,
for he did not once glance around or backward, but
rose the swell and disappeared beyond its crest with the same
mad, reckless gallop.</p>
<p>Ayres rose with a cry of astonishment, as the man vanished
from sight. A puzzled look rested upon his face.</p>
<p>In the brief glance he had obtained of the rider&rsquo;s features,
he knew that it was a white man but wonder had checked
the cry of greeting, he would otherwise have uttered. Buenos
did not know that the mad rider was none other than Dusky
Dick, the traitor guide and black-hearted renegade; but such
was indeed the case.</p>
<p>Had he known it, Ayres would have sent a revolver bullet
hissing after the villain, on the instant, instead of now gazing
at the little cloud of dust that was all there was left to
indicate the swift passage. But then Buenos once more returned
his way, with quickened steps.</p>

<br />SAVAGE TACTICS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Tom!&rdquo; abruptly muttered Travers, gently touching
the shoulder of his ruminating companion. &ldquo;The red
rascals are moving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Delaware turned his keen eyes toward the valley and
gazed for a moment in silence. Then he answered, in a
slightly vexed tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, dey go hide, now. Skeered plenty bad, dey is.
Don&rsquo;t know what to mek &rsquo;cause Kisch-kouch git killed. T&rsquo;ink
spirits here, mebbe. Go hide&mdash;den watch plenty sharp.
Dat&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that will not do, Tom,&rdquo; added Travers, vexedly.
&ldquo;They will keep us here all night, then. If we venture to
move, they&rsquo;ll pick us off, one after the other. I wish we
had fired at them as they stood out there&mdash;but it&rsquo;s too late
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh&mdash;see&mdash;dey hide now. Ought to shoot <i>den</i>&mdash;now
<i>can&rsquo;t</i>. Shoot&mdash;kill one, two, den oders run &rsquo;way off, like de
debble. Cap&rsquo;n he say <i>no</i>&mdash;see now dat Delaware was right,&rdquo;
tersely replied the savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall we do? That fellow has gone for help,
no doubt, and when he comes back they&rsquo;ll soon make this
place too hot for us. As it is, those devils can hold us here
as long as they feel like it. We can&rsquo;t move without bringing
out a rifle-bullet. Come, find some way, Tom,&rdquo; impatiently
added Travers, who evidently relied far more upon
the cunning and resources of his companion in times of difficulty
like this, than upon his own powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me do it. Skeer Arapahoe <i>bad</i>, dis time. Git scalp, too,
ef don&rsquo;t look out. No fun, dough, skeer <i>dem</i>&mdash;git skeered
too easy&mdash;den run plenty fast. Got long legs, dem Arapahoes,&rdquo;
chuckled Tom, as he drew his knife from the belt at
his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you intend doing, Delaware?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep eyes open wide, den mebbe so you see,&rdquo; grunted
the savage, who evidently felt his importance in no small degree.</p>
<p>With his knife he cut several scrubby bushes, and then
bound them around his head and shoulders, but in such a
manner that they would not interfere materially with his
sight. This accomplished to his satisfaction, he turned toward
Travers, who was now dividing his attention between
his companion and the valley below, where the red-skins were
hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you open ear&mdash;me tell. Injuns down dere&mdash;you
here&mdash;me go some oder place. Den me shoot Arapahoe&mdash;de
oders dey jump up, all same like rabbit&mdash;don&rsquo;t know where
me be&mdash;den <i>you</i> shoot&mdash;kill &rsquo;noder. Den me holler <i>loud</i>&mdash;<i>you</i>
holler&mdash;<i>dey</i> holler an&rsquo; run like de debble, &rsquo;way off.
See?&rdquo; hurriedly explained Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to crawl around them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh&mdash;dat&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shoot one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shoot &rsquo;noder&mdash;den dey run &rsquo;way off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they would,&rdquo; thoughtfully said Travers. &ldquo;But
it will be dangerous for you. Can you get down without
their seeing you? If they do, you&rsquo;re a dead man sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;dey shoot, but can&rsquo;t hit Delaware. <i>Can&rsquo;t</i> hit&mdash;don&rsquo;t
know <i>how</i> shoot, dem Arapahoe. Hit hill, mebbe, not&rsquo;ing
else,&rdquo; laughed Tom, a low, gleesome laugh, full of joy at the
prospect of outwitting his hereditary foes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you think an Arapahoe is fit for nothing but
crow-bait, Tom, but you may get fooled. Some of them are
brave and cunning warriors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, Arapahoe squaw&mdash;all squaw!&rdquo; angrily hissed
the Delaware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have it your own way. But be careful. Don&rsquo;t be
foolhardy, man, and throw away your life uselessly. Better
go now; it&rsquo;s growing late and there&rsquo;s no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Delaware turned away without a word, and passing
his companion, he disappeared among the bushes beyond.
Though he affected to laugh at the danger of his venture, nevertheless
it was a perilous one, and one, too, that would require
not a little caution and skill to carry out successfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>As stated, the line of bushes fringed the base of the cliff,
and then ran out, leaving the hillside bare and devoid of
cover, except a few small bowlders and patches of stunted
grass. For nearly fifty yards this stretch lay beneath the full
vision of the warriors hidden below.</p>
<p>But Delaware Tom felt assured that he could accomplish
the feat, and truly, he, if any one, could do so. Those who
were with Kearney in California can bear me out in this assertion.</p>
<p>Aided by the leafy screen upon his head, and the bowlders
scattered around, he hoped to pass over this open space unobserved,
and this once done, he would have the best of cover
for his further operations. As for the rest of the programme,
he considered that the same as settled.</p>
<p>He knew that most, if not all the six Indians were Arapahoes,
and as seen, he looked upon them with supreme contempt.
He believed that at his shot, they would act much
as he had said, and the way be easily cleared for his friend&rsquo;s
departure for the camp.</p>
<p>When he gained the end of the bushes, Tom paused
and peered keenly out upon the valley below. But even his
sharp eyes could not detect the presence of a foe, save in the
riderless horses that were feeding on the bank of the creek.</p>
<p>Still, he knew pretty well where the savages were hidden,
and acted accordingly. Now he was forced to &ldquo;crawfish,&rdquo; or
in other words, to crawl backward, as his head and shoulders
were the only parts of his person concealed by the bush.</p>
<p>By so doing he calculated upon reaching a little gully that
ran down to the creek, unobserved, as the bush would seem
to stand still, from where the Indians were hidden, for to
gain this ditch, Tom would be forced to back directly from
their position. All this had been foreseen by the Delaware
and calculated upon when he spoke so confidently of success
in his bold ruse.</p>
<p>Slowly and carefully he proceeded&mdash;or receded&mdash;crouching
low down, keeping the leafy head-dress as steady as possible
under the circumstances. His eyes were riveted upon the
spot where he believed the Arapahoes to be hidden, his
muscles in readiness to avoid a shot, should such be threatened,
by a sudden spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>But that shot did not come, and it was plain that the savages
either did not notice, or else believed the bush to be a
natural one. It would have required a long and careful scrutiny
from the point where they were lying hid, to tell that
the bush moved, for Tom was retreating in an almost direct
line from them. Besides, the moonlight was deceitful and
favored the working of the ruse.</p>
<p>Then Tom gained the edge of the gully, and gently backed
over it, alighting upon his feet in the soft dirt and <i>debris</i> that
covered the bottom. He listened intently for a moment, but
all was still.</p>
<p>A glow of grim delight swept athwart his features at this,
for he knew that the enemy were still ignorant of the plan on
foot to circumvent them. The Delaware, now that the most
difficult portion of his task was accomplished, felt no doubt
but the rest would end as happily.</p>
<p>With the friendly twigs still upon his head, he turned and
glided down the gully, after unslinging the rifle from his back,
and carefully inspecting the cap. From seeing the enemy disappear,
Tom had formed a pretty accurate idea of where they
were hid.</p>
<p>He knew that they had not recrossed the creek, and consequently
they only had an oblong circle of some two score
yards diameter, in which to conceal themselves. Inside this,
then, Tom knew he must find his game.</p>
<p>Gliding along, crouching so that his head was below the
level of the bank, the Delaware soon gained the bank of the
creek, and pausing, he peered cautiously toward the suspected
spot. A low grunt of disgust broke from his lips, as he saw
that a little ridge hid the Indians from his view, while standing
in the gully.</p>
<p>Then his eyes roved around, restlessly. A brief moment
sufficed to form his plans.</p>
<p>Removing the revolver from his girdle, he entered the
stream, and then holding the weapon above the water, he
glided slowly along toward the enemy, hidden, as before, by
the bank. As many minutes sufficed to carry him over the
few yards necessary to traverse, and then, confident that he
had gained a point whence he could spot the red-skins, Tom
prepared for action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The revolver he cautiously shoved upon the edge of the
bank, beside a small bowlder, and then followed it with the
muzzle of his rifle. But then, with a sudden recollection, he
paused.</p>
<p>Along the bank, for a number of yards, there was not a
bush or shrub of any kind to be seen. Although he affected
to despise the Arapahoes as warriors, the Delaware knew right
well that the sudden appearance of a bush where none had
grown before, could scarcely escape their keen eyes; and, under
the peculiar circumstances, its appearance would most
probably be greeted with a rifle-ball.</p>
<p>So he noiselessly untied the thongs that secured the leafy
head dress in place, suffering it to drop into the water, and
float away with the gentle current. Then he slowly raised
his eyes to a level with the bank.</p>
<p>For a full minute nothing suspicious rewarded his gaze;
but Tom was by far too cunning a scout and warrior to risk
the success of his plans by a precipitate movement. Then his
eyes slowly roved over each inch of the ground, again and
again.</p>
<p>The wisdom of this caution was soon apparent. Beside a
goodly-sized bowlder, the Delaware now discovered a portion
of a red-skin&rsquo;s body, though at first it had appeared part and
parcel of the stone.</p>
<p>This was enough. Tom knew that sufficient was revealed
to bury a bullet in, so that it would touch the seat of life, and
that by waiting for a better target, he might spoil all.</p>
<p>Slowly and deliberately, as if aiming at a target of wood,
the rifle drew upon the unsuspecting savage, and the black
eye of the Delaware flashed along the dark tube with a deadly
glare. And then his finger tightened upon the trigger.</p>
<p>The whip-like crack rung out with startling clearness; but
it was blended with a horrible yell of agony, as the stricken
savage writhed upon the ground in his death-throes. Delaware
Tom seldom found it necessary to fire twice at the same
object.</p>
<p>As the sounds broke the air, the horses, that had been
quietly cropping the rich grass, snorted with affright, and after
turning their heads wildly, sprung off a few yards; then
stood with trembling limbs, eying the strange scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>As Tom had anticipated, the unexpected shot had so startled
the red-skins that they sprung up from their coverts and
glared wildly around in search of their hidden foe. Cries of
wondering fear broke from their lips.</p>
<p>Then a spout of flame shot forth from the line of bushes
upon the hillside, and a second messenger of death sped upon
its way; another of the savages reeled wildly, and then fell
to the ground, the hot life-blood gurgling from his chest.</p>
<p>Delaware Tom snatched his revolver and discharged it, uttering
a wild yell&mdash;the war-whoop that had more than once
carried terror and confusion into the hearts of his foemen.
Though this shot did not seem to have taken effect, the bold
fellow sprung forth from the water, and pealing forth his
yell, sprung toward the surviving Arapahoes, firing as he
came.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, there echoed back a hoarse cheer from the
hillside, and Travers sprung into view, his revolver echoing
back the quick reports from that in the hands of the Delaware.</p>
<p>As yet the Arapahoes had not burned a grain of powder,
so greatly were they confused by this sudden and deadly onset.
The two men dashing toward them, with rapidly detonating
pistols, were magnified ten-fold, and, as with one accord,
the survivors turned and fled from the spot of death, with wild
screeches of dismay and terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, Tom! spot them&mdash;they&rsquo;re ours!&rdquo; shouted Travers,
wild with excitement, as his revolver sent a bullet crashing
into the brain of a third red-skin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let one get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud and clear came the answering yell of the Delaware,
as he sprung forward in hot pursuit of the fleeing foe. <i>He</i>
only thought that his enemies were before him, and his heart
was filled with ferocious hatred.</p>
<p>The foremost Arapahoe reached the horses, and it seemed
as though the secondary object of the two scouts would be
defeated, after all; but the frantic haste of the savage favored
them, unexpectedly. In his terror, he made a quick grasp at
the trailing halter; but his foot slipping upon the damp grass,
he fell to the ground, even as his fingers tightened upon the
plaited rope.</p>
<p>The sudden jerk added to the mustang&rsquo;s affright, and caused
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
him to rear violently back, half-raising the Indian to his feet;
but then the hand slipped from the smooth rope, and thus
freed, the terrified horse turned with a shrill scream and dashed
madly up the valley, followed by its companions.</p>
<p>A faint cry broke from the lips of the Arapahoes, at this
new misfortune, but they dared not pause. Close behind
them they could hear the heavy tramp of their enemies, and
then came two more shots.</p>
<p>Without pausing a moment, the savages dashed on, while
the one whose haste had wrought them such harm, scrambled
to his feet. But no sooner was he up, than he was down
again.</p>
<p>Delaware Tom, with a shrill scream of frantic fury, pounced
upon his back, hurling the red-skin violently forward, his face
plowing up the decayed grass and soft dirt. Half-senseless
from the shock, he offered but feeble resistance to his powerful
enemy.</p>
<p>Delaware Tom dug his knees violently into the back of
the Arapahoe, while one hand clutched his neck with the force
of a vise. Then the empty revolver was upraised, for a moment
remaining motionless to gather momentum; then the
heavy, brass-bound butt fell with a sickening <i>thud</i> full upon
the bared head of the ill-fated savage.</p>
<p>Another yell broke from Tom&rsquo;s lips, as he dashed the clotted
blood and brains from his eyes, and sprung to his feet,
glaring ferociously around in search of another victim. But
the carnage was over.</p>
<p>The two surviving Arapahoes had vanished among the
shadows, and Travers was returning from the pursuit. But
Tom darted forward, his eyes glowing with a diabolical
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Tom,&rdquo; cried the soldier, as he grasped his comrade,
&ldquo;where are you going? They&rsquo;ve got clear off by now. You
couldn&rsquo;t find them in the dark, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go&mdash;me kill Arapahoe debble!&rdquo; snarled the Delaware,
struggling fiercely in the powerful grasp of the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re gone. Don&rsquo;t be a fool, man. There&rsquo;s four
scalps, if you want them. That&rsquo;s enough for once. Do you
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savage suddenly ceased his struggles, though with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
ill-grace. But then his face brightened as he glanced back
upon the ghastly forms of the fallen red-skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, help me catch their horses, first, Tom,&rdquo; said
Travers. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t mind they&rsquo;ll give us the slip altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the Delaware followed his companion up
the valley, where they could hear the frightened horses, still
snorting wildly. The soldier began to fear they would experience
not a little trouble in effecting their capture.</p>
<p>But both he and the Delaware were old hands among the
horses, and Tom set out to gain the further side of the animals,
in order to prevent their flight. This was quickly accomplished,
and then, while Travers stood still, the Delaware
slowly advanced toward the trembling group.</p>
<p>They permitted his approach without a motion, save to
huddle closer together, until nearly within arm&rsquo;s length, but
then they dashed off toward the soldier. Travers stood still
with outstretched hand, and, after a few minutes&rsquo; delay, one
of them came close enough for him to secure the halter.</p>
<p>Then it was an easy task to collect the others, which once
accomplished, the two men returned down the valley where
had taken place the deadly surprise. The four dead forms
presented a ghastly sight, and even Travers could not repress
a shudder, as he recalled the frightful scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take their scalps, if you will, Tom,&rdquo; he said, as the Delaware
drew his knife. &ldquo;But be quick about it. And then
tumble their bodies into the creek, before we call the lady.
The sight would be horrible enough to kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squaw no so soft like dat,&rdquo; laughed the Delaware, as he
shook the first trophy to free it from the gouts of blood, before
securing it to his girdle. &ldquo;Stan&rsquo; big heap, dey kin. No
kill &rsquo;um so easy, like dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up&mdash;don&rsquo;t be so long, Tom. There&rsquo;s a long trail
before us, and not much time to lose. It&rsquo;s nearly daylight
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Delaware seemed to find a peculiar pleasure in his
revolting task, and took his own time about it. This was
the reward of his tedious exercise of Indian tactics.</p>
<p>But then the job was completed by dragging the mutilated
dead to the stream, and casting them in, when the current
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
quickly swept them away. As the last corpse disappeared,
Travers raised his voice and bade Clara come down; that all
danger was past.</p>
<p>But there came no reply. Again he called, louder than
before. Still the silence, save in the echoes of his own voice
among the hills.</p>
<p>Travers wondered at this, though he did not think of any
serious wrong. He believed that Clara, frightened by the
wild struggle, had not yet recovered sufficiently to recognize
his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Tom, hold the horses, and I will go up after her,&rdquo;
said Travers, a little impatiently. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s afraid to come
down alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muttering at the foolish squeamishness of the white squaw,
the Delaware did as bade, and then the soldier lightly bounded
up the steep hillside. As he neared the line of bushes,
Travers called again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Calhoun&mdash;Clara, come out. It is all over, and the
road is free for us. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no answer, save in the echoes of his own voice as before.
A strange fear seized upon the strong-hearted soldier.</p>
<p>Why this continued silence? Why did not the maiden
answer him? Could it be, that, frightened at the scene of
death and bloodshed, she had fainted?</p>
<p>Believing this the true solution of the dead stillness, he
sprung forward and parted the bushes. A wild cry broke
from his lips.</p>
<p>The covert was empty&mdash;unoccupied, save by the still and
lifeless form of the Arapahoe, who had fallen by the strong
hand of Delaware Tom. Where was Clara?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fo&rsquo; you mek holler like dat? Where squaw?&rdquo;
called out the Delaware from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! Tom, she&rsquo;s gone! She is not here!&rdquo; gasped
Travers, in wondering alarm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />BOUND TO THE STAKE.</h2>
<p>The situation of old Tom Maxwell, was not one to be
envied. Lying helplessly bound, surrounded by a score of
yelling, exultant red-skins, who showered kicks and cuffs upon
him with merciless celerity.</p>
<p>Taken in the very act of slaying one of their comrades, he
could expect but little mercy at their hands; indeed he felt
some surprise that they spared his life even for those few
moments.</p>
<p>Suddenly a tall, powerful form strode through the corral,
rudely elbowing the braves aside, all resistance ceasing as
they caught sight of the one who handled them so unceremoniously.
Evidently the new-comer was one high in rank
among them, judging from the deference with which he was
regarded.</p>
<p>Waving back the red-skins, he stood over the form of the
captive scout, gazing keenly at his upturned features. A
quick and powerful change passed over his face, and a
hoarse cry broke from his lips, while one hand nervously
clutched the tomahawk that hung at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! Three Scalps!&rdquo; he uttered in his native tongue;
and even then there seemed to be a tinge of respectful admiration
in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yas, so they call me in your lingo, &rsquo;Rapahoe,&rdquo; coolly returned
Maxwell, as he gazed fixedly at the face of the savage.
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you know how you arn&rsquo;t the name, don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, me know. Big warrior, <i>you</i>. Kill heap Arapahoe.
Won&rsquo;t kill no more, dough. Git kill <i>self</i>, bumbye. How
like <i>dat</i>, eh?&rdquo; added the Indian, with a leer of ferocious joy
upon his features, as he crouched over the captive pale-face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, chief, ontel a&rsquo;ter I&rsquo;ve tried it a time or two.
Reckon I&rsquo;d like it fust rate, soon&rsquo;s I git kinder used to it a
bit. But you&rsquo;re jokin&rsquo;, ain&rsquo;t ye, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jokin&rsquo;&mdash;wha&rsquo; dat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Foolin&rsquo;&mdash;makin&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieve&mdash;sorter throwin&rsquo; dust in a feller&rsquo;s
eyes, like, ye know, so to speak. What fer do you want to
kill me? I hain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo; much, onless it is killin&rsquo; a
few dozen &rsquo;Rapahoes, fer which you&rsquo;d orter thank me, &rsquo;stead
o&rsquo; holdin&rsquo; any grudge,&rdquo; and the reckless old scout chuckled
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kill Arapahoe&mdash;Arapahoes kill <i>you</i>. Kill Cagoula
here, kill oder brave ober dere. You die fo&rsquo; dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other? You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to blame a feller fer what
ain&rsquo;t his fault, be ye? Ef I tuck a notion to shoot out here
at a bunch o&rsquo; grass, an&rsquo; one o&rsquo; your durned copper-skins runs
ag&rsquo;inst the bullet, be I to blame? But I didn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;you cain&rsquo;t
prove &rsquo;at I killed any other skunk &rsquo;cept this &rsquo;ere one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kin too, me tell. Kill &rsquo;noder brave down dere&mdash;in water&mdash;stick
one wid knife. Den run &rsquo;way like de debble,&rdquo;
angrily added the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&mdash;where was that?&rdquo; asked Maxwell, a sudden hope
springing up in his breast at the last words of the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you tek good hoss&mdash;ride like debble&mdash;mek hair
all wet on hoss. <i>Dat</i> long, mebbe,&rdquo; tersely replied the Arapahoe.</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s form quivered with a new-born hope. He
knew that the time metaphorically stated by the chief,
would be about that which had transpired since the alarm
had arose, so closely following the desperate venture of Buenos
Ayres. Could it be that he had been deceived&mdash;that the
young man had indeed eluded the vigilance of his enemies,
and was still at liberty?</p>
<p>For some moments Tom dared not trust himself to speak.
He dreaded lest the swarthy Hercules should suspect the truth
from his tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the feller who tried to stop me down thar?
In the water?&rdquo; he said, at a venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellers didn&rsquo;t see me, then, as I swum back up the
river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You do dat way?&rdquo; eagerly asked the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In course. You hunted fer me, didn&rsquo;t you? Ef I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo;
stayed thar you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; found me, wouldn&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, me see now. Injun he big fool dat time, but got
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
you now. Keep you, too. Tek scalp bumbye. How you
like burn at stake, eh? Laugh plenty loud, den, eh? T&rsquo;ink
so?&rdquo; and the chief chuckled diabolically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me&mdash;burn <i>me</i>? Git out&mdash;you&rsquo;re crazy, Injun. <i>Cain&rsquo;t</i> do
that. Won&rsquo;t burn; &rsquo;d putt the fire all out. I&rsquo;m all frozen
water, <i>I</i> be. Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. Bet ye my hat &rsquo;at I kin
stan&rsquo; fire longer &rsquo;thout sizzlin&rsquo; &rsquo;n <i>you</i> kin. Thar now, what
sez ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savage laughed a little at the sublime impudence of
his captive, but then turned away and entered into conversation
with several of the more prominent braves.</p>
<p>Maxwell had an object in view in thus chaffing with his
captor. He felt assured now that Buenos Ayres had indeed
succeeded in passing the cordon in safety, and that he was
even then far away in search of help.</p>
<p>Thus, every moment of time gained was invaluable to his
comrades. If he could delay an attack until daylight, he
believed that the train would be saved, as the Indians would
scarcely brave an assault in broad daytime, knowing the
great loss they must suffer in such a case.</p>
<p>Hoping to learn something definite regarding the red-skins&rsquo;
plans, Tom keenly strained his ears to catch the words of
those who were collected around the chief, at but a few yards
from where stood the captive scout. His partial knowledge
of the dialect stood him in good stead here.</p>
<p>He heard his own name&mdash;or the <i>sobriquet</i> given him for a
deed of peculiar daring some years before, Three Scalps&mdash;coupled
together with the emigrant train; and then another
name met his ear. That of Dusky Dick.</p>
<p>His suspicious, then, were only too true. This desperate
attack was indeed the work of the Traitor Guide. These
savages were under his orders; then where was he?</p>
<p>But soon other interests riveted his attention upon the savages,
once more. They were debating upon <i>him</i>&mdash;settling the
mode and time of <i>his death</i>.</p>
<p>Despite his hardihood and great bravery, the old guide
shuddered as he caught the words of the chief. To die&mdash;and
by such a death&mdash;was horrible!</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hands are red with the blood of the Arapahoe&mdash;he
must <i>die</i>! But he is a great brave&mdash;his name is Three
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Scalps. Do you know how he gained that name? Listen!
Four Arapahoe braves attacked him upon the prairie and shot
his horse: he was alone. They were good braves and skillful
warriors, but they were no match for him. He killed
and took the scalps of three&mdash;the other fled, with a bullet
through his breast. He gained the lodges of his people, and
told his story; then he died. We called the white warrior
Three Scalps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a great brave, but he must die. He has fallen into
our power at last&mdash;but the death of a man awaits him. He
shall die by fire&mdash;the wolves must not pick his bones. Wapashaw
has spoken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief is wise,&rdquo; slowly uttered one of the elder braves.
&ldquo;But does he not forget? What will the white chief say?
He bade us capture this man and keep him so that he might
slay him with his own hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wapashaw is a chief. Who shall say he does wrong?
Not a pale-face, with blood like water. Is the White Snake
greater than a chief of the Arapahoes? No! He does not
dare speak hot words to Wapashaw. He knows that my arm
is strong and my tomahawk sharp. Three Scalps must die&mdash;I
have said it!&rdquo; sternly added the chief, as he turned away.</p>
<p>Where was Dusky Dick? Why did he not put in an appearance,
now that one of his bitterest enemies was helplessly
a captive? This fact puzzled Tom not a little. But then he
thought of the imminent peril that threatened himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Durned consolin&rsquo;, that is&mdash;I guess <i>not</i>!&rdquo; muttered Tom,
disgustedly. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;d orter feel proud, but I don&rsquo;t&mdash;not
a mite. B&rsquo;lieve I&rsquo;d ruther they&rsquo;d think I was a pesky coward,
ef so be they&rsquo;d think I wasn&rsquo;t wuth sizzlin&rsquo;. Ugh! it
makes the sweat come, jest to think on it! What&rsquo;ll it be
<i>then</i>, though? Oh, Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched the movements of the savages with anxious
eyes. Although as brave as most men, there was something
fearful in contemplating this mode of being sent out of the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder ef it&rsquo;ll hurt <i>much</i>. Bet it will; know it, &rsquo;most.
Ef &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t keer so much. Wish to ge-mineezers
&rsquo;at I&rsquo;d stayed in the corral,&rdquo; grumbled Tom, as he tugged
desperately upon his bonds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>But this effort was in vain. The hide-thongs had been
applied by too careful a hand, for him to slip them from his
wrists, and the tough cords only sunk deeper into the yielding
flesh, with each succeeding effort.</p>
<p>It was quite evident that whatever scruples a few of the
elder braves might have entertained as to the advisability of
such a decided course, were quickly overruled by the stern-willed
chief, Wapashaw, and then the necessary preparations
for the feast were speedily under way. A score of savages
dashed away toward the timber belt, with drawn hatchets,
and then came the quick, heavy strokes, telling that wood was
being collected.</p>
<p>Maxwell noted their movements with naturally troubled
feelings. He saw his fate was sealed beyond a doubt, unless
he could effect an escape.</p>
<p>But this seemed impossible. Alone, he was helpless as
an infant. There was nothing for it but to watch and wait.</p>
<p>In a short time the savages returned from the timber-belt,
bearing huge back-loads of dried wood, which, at a word
from Wapashaw, they carried over to the hill, near whose
top it was heaped. There was a double meaning in this selection
of the spot for the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Of a necessity, there must be a number of braves left
around the corral to guard against another messenger venturing
forth, and these would wish to witness the sport. Did it
take place upon the hillside, they could do so as well as those
within the corral.</p>
<p>The hill, too, was beyond reach of rifle-shot, and so the
bright light could not serve to guide an avenging bullet.
For these reasons had the hill been selected by the astute
chief of the Arapahoes.</p>
<p>Then the form of the old guide was lifted from the ground
by several brawny warriors, and borne toward the rudely-improvised
stake. Tom&rsquo;s heart sunk anew, for he hoped to be
able to break away from his captors, during the walk to the
hill. But Wapashaw knew too well the nature of the man
he had to deal with, to run any unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>Maxwell uttered a bitter curse of rage as he realized this.
But a savage leer upon the countenance of Wapashaw revealed
the delight his chagrin gave the rascal, and Tom smothered
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
his emotion, until he gave no outward sign of feeling his
position, though his teeth were firmly clenched and his breath
came hard and strong.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the hill was gained, and the old scout
was placed with his back against the firmly-planted stake.
Not until a strong lariat was twined around both his body
and the post, were his feet freed from their bonds, his hands
still remaining tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; grunted Wapashaw, as he stood ordering the proceeding,
addressing Maxwell. &ldquo;Three Scalps no &rsquo;feared
<i>now</i>? Holler plenty loud, by-&rsquo;m-by, when fire burns. T&rsquo;ink
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, chief. You&rsquo;ll only git fooled ef you &rsquo;xpect
<i>me</i> to holler. Fire cain&rsquo;t burn me&mdash;<i>it</i> cain&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m proof ag&rsquo;in&rsquo;
lead an&rsquo; steel, too. Didn&rsquo;t know that afore, did ye? Why
you mought stan&rsquo; thar an&rsquo; shoot your rifle plum ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; my
face, an&rsquo; the bullit &rsquo;d jest bounce back ag&rsquo;in, like it hed hit a
rock. Your hatchet &rsquo;ed break jest like a piece o&rsquo; ice, ef you
was to hit me, <i>hard</i>. It would <i>so</i>!&rdquo; earnestly responded Tom.
&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you try it an&rsquo; see, now, jest fer fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wapashaw gazed steadily at the old guide for a moment,
but then a grim smile swept athwart his countenance. He
divined the motive that actuated his captive, but was far from
willing to gratify him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you t&rsquo;ink Arapahoe chief he big fool, talk like
dat? S&rsquo;pose shoot&mdash;hit &rsquo;um wid tom&rsquo;hawk, den &rsquo;um go <i>dead,
quick</i>. Den no git burn. Three Scalps brave, plenty cunning,
but so Wapashaw. No git fooled <i>dis</i> time,&rdquo; and the
chief chuckled sardonically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>git</i> out! Think ye&rsquo;re <i>some</i>, don&rsquo;t ye? Durned smart,
you be&mdash;whar the hide&rsquo;s rubbed off. Fool nothin&rsquo;&mdash;cain&rsquo;t
spile a rotten aigg, you durned gumphead, you,&rdquo; retorted Tom,
with an angry glare in his eyes.</p>
<p>He had indeed strove to induce the chief to end all at one
blow, by his boasting, for he had racked his brain in vain to
devise some other mode of escaping the horrible death. Feeling
assured that his time to die was at hand, he wished it
over at once.</p>
<p>Though Maxwell spoke boldly enough, there was a dull,
heavy sinking at his heart, as he noted the preparations for
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
his torture. He knew that mortal man could never endure
that fearful trial, without giving utterance to his agony.</p>
<p>He knew that death would come, but it would be lingering;
before oblivion, he must suffer ten thousand deaths. That is
what he desired to escape.</p>
<p>The dried fagots were piled around at a few yards&rsquo; distance
from the stake, so that death should not too quickly claim
its victim. Time must be given them to do ample honor to
the great bravery and prowess that Three Scalps had so frequently
displayed, greatly to their harm.</p>
<p>Tom could look down upon the corral, though it was but
faintly outlined in the dim light, for the moon had sunk low
down, and daybreak was close at hand. He knew that his
comrades must be cognizant of his capture, whether they also
knew of his threatened doom or no.</p>
<p>But he could expect no assistance from them. They would
have enough to do in guarding themselves, and the dear,
helpless ones depending upon their strong arms for safety.</p>
<p>Then Wapashaw took a torch that had been hastily kindled
by one of the warriors, and holding it to the dry kindlings,
the pile of fagots was soon in a blaze, shooting up
from a dozen different points. And around the funeral pyre
danced the yelling and screeching red-skins, apparently half
frantic with demoniac joy.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />THE WINDING TRAIL.</h2>
<p>At this wild cry from Captain Travers, Delaware Tom
abandoned the horses they had secured after so much trouble
and danger, and darted up the hill-side toward the spot where
such a startling discovery had been made by the soldier. It
did not seem possible, and the Indian evidently believed that
Travers had made some mistake in the spot.</p>
<p>But then he also saw that Clara was gone from the place
where she had been left but a few short minutes before.
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Gone&mdash;where? Why had she fled? Or had some enemy
spirited her away?</p>
<p>These were the questions that poured from the lips of the
soldier, as his comrade gained his side. For a time Tom
made no reply, and bent low down over the ground, as if trying
to read the truth by some sign left there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gone&mdash;dat all we know now,&rdquo; grunted the Delaware,
as he rose erect. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;mebbe tell bumbye,
when light comes &rsquo;g&rsquo;in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that any one has carried her off, Tom?&rdquo;
asked Travers, agitatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so&mdash;mebbe not so. Don&rsquo;t know not&rsquo;ing, me say.
Too much dark&mdash;can&rsquo;t see. She gone, dat all me kin tell
now,&rdquo; persisted the Delaware, doggedly.</p>
<p>Travers glanced anxiously up at the heavens. The moon
had rolled on, until the cliff above their heads shut off the
light from the hill-side.</p>
<p>All there was dim and indistinct; light enough to distinguish
forms, but not sufficiently so to trace out a trail, especially
when left upon the rocky ground by so light a foot as
that of the missing maiden. As Tom had said, the truth
could not be learned until the day had dawned.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this period was not far distant. A couple of
hours, at most, and the sun would make its appearance.</p>
<p>But in that length of time, what might not happen? If
the maiden was in the hands of an enemy, she would be conveyed
far beyond their reach before they could strike the
trail.</p>
<p>And then there was danger to themselves, too, as well.
The messenger who had been dispatched for help, hours before,
by the Arapahoes, might return at any moment, bringing
a force that they could not hope to cope with successfully.
Or the two savages who had fled the massacre of their comrades
might chance upon friends, and gathering courage
from that fact, return to avenge the slaughter of their brethren.</p>
<p>All these thoughts agitated the minds of the two men, as
they stood gazing gloomily upon each other. That they were
puzzled was plain; equally plain was it that not for even a
moment did either think of abandoning to her fate the maiden
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
who had so strangely been thrown upon their protection,
and for whom they had already dared so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must we do now, Tom?&rdquo; muttered Travers, speaking
mechanically; not that he hoped to gain any thing by
the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not&rsquo;ing now&mdash;bumbye do <i>somefin</i>. When light come
ag&rsquo;in, we take trail&mdash;foller up till fin&rsquo; squaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think we can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know so&mdash;almost. Got eye plenty sharp, Tom. Foller
trail in water, ef try <i>hard</i>. Me foller trail&mdash;Cap&rsquo;n ride hoss.
Den we git her&mdash;go back camp&mdash;laugh like de debble, &rsquo;cause
skeered when squaw git lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she may have been carried off?&rdquo; suggested the soldier,
taking the gloomy side of the question as the true one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t t&rsquo;ink <i>dat</i>. Injun grab her, squaw holler <i>so</i>
loud&mdash;squeal all some like pant&rsquo;er. Den we hear, sure. No
holler loud&mdash;den Injun no take. She git skeered, mebbe,
&rsquo;cause &rsquo;um kill Arapahoe. Don&rsquo;t know much when skeered.
No see straight&mdash;t&rsquo;ink mebbe a <i>frien&rsquo;</i> git kill&mdash;not bad Injun.
Den &rsquo;fraid dey git her, too, so run &rsquo;way off, plenty fast. Me
t&rsquo;ink <i>dat</i>,&rdquo; succinctly stated Tom, with the argumentative air
of a lawyer summing up his case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; eagerly cried Travers. &ldquo;Then she
may be hidden somewhere near here. Surely she could not
run far, she was so weak from her fall. If you call, she may
hear and answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You holler, if you like. Me go git horses &rsquo;g&rsquo;in. Don&rsquo;t like
much walk, when kin ride. Plenty better, <i>dat</i>,&rdquo; grinned the
Delaware, who begun descending the hillside toward the captured
animals, who had stood still on being left.</p>
<p>Travers acted upon this supposition, making the hills echo
with the sound of his voice calling aloud the maiden&rsquo;s name
as clearly as possible. But there came back no answering
call.</p>
<p>If the Delaware&rsquo;s supposition as to Clara&rsquo;s voluntary flight
was true, then she must have run to a great distance, or she
could not have failed hearing the cries. At length the soldier
ceased in despair. There was nothing for it but to await the
coming day before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Tom secured the horses to a bush, and then taking a philosophical
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
view of the matter, comfortably seated himself in a
mossy nook, lighting his pipe and smoking with the gusto of
an epicure. But Travers could not content himself thus.</p>
<p>Though he had known the maiden but a few brief hours,
as time is usually computed, that seemed most like a year of
ordinary time, so full of adventure had it been. The bright eyes
and sweet face of Clara Calhoun, had made a vivid impression
upon his heart, and he felt this suspense very keenly.</p>
<p>No doubt he would have laughed to scorn the idea of his
being in love with her, had it suggested itself, but truly, the
feeling he now experienced was not unlike the first dawning
of that subtle sentiment called <i>love</i>. Honestly, the gallant captain
was in greater danger then, than he had ever been before
in the whole course of his eventful life, had he but known it.</p>
<p>Travers, in his anxiety to be doing something, scaled the
hill and kept a close look out, to guard against being taken
by surprise, in case the Arapahoe&rsquo;s messenger should return.
But Tom sunk into a peaceful doze beside his rock, no doubt
living over again in his dreams the glorious sport he had so
lately had, in outwitting and putting to rout his foes, the Arapahoes.</p>
<p>But all things must have an end, and that eventful night
was no exception to the general rule. With the first golden
rays of the rising sun gilding the eastern hill-tops, Travers descended
to where Delaware Tom was awaiting his coming.</p>
<p>Their preparations for the coming campaign were necessarily
very brief. A long draught from the creek, constituted
all their breakfast for the nonce, as the last bit of food
had passed their lips on the preceding night.</p>
<p>Then while the soldier secured the horses for marching,
Tom quartered the ground adjoining the covert, where still
lay the slaughtered Kisch-kouch, searching for the trail of the
missing maiden. In a few minutes his glad cry echoed forth,
and Travers knew that the quest had been successful.</p>
<p>As he hastened to the spot, his eyes, though keen, were at
fault, though Tom declared the trail was remarkably plain&mdash;that
Clara had passed over the ground at a rapid pace, though
<i>alone</i>. A joyous cry burst from the captain&rsquo;s lips at this welcome
announcement, for now he did not doubt of being successful
in finding the girl in a very short time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>It also confirmed the supposition of the Delaware, that she
had taken affright at the wild tumult attending the surprise,
and perhaps had fancied her friends were being overpowered.
But now Tom stood upon his dignity as chief trailer, and motioned
Travers back, to act as rear-guard.</p>
<p>The trail led down the hillside for some little distance, then
crossed the ridge and descended into the level prairie beyond.
Now even Travers could easily note the dainty footprints upon
the dew-dampened ground.</p>
<p>He also saw with pleasure, that its course was one heading
almost directly toward the camping-ground of his own
train, so that they were in reality losing but very little time.
This he rejoiced in, for he knew that his men would be uneasy
at his long absence, as they had not intended stopping
out over night.</p>
<p>For several miles the trail continued, not in a direct line,
but zig-zag hither and yon, as if the girl had become confused
and wandered aimlessly in a roundabout manner. And
while Tom traced this out, step by step, Travers, seated upon
a horse, gazed keenly around in every direction, hoping to
thus gain sight of the wanderer, sooner than otherwise.</p>
<p>And his search proved successful, for, just as Tom uttered
a cry of surprise, Travers caught sight of a human form, upon
the swell of a hill, perhaps a mile away. Then the figure
abruptly disappeared from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! look dere!&rdquo; muttered Tom, as he came to an abrupt
stop.</p>
<p>Travers followed the direction indicated by the outstretched
finger. The trail they were following suddenly became <i>a
double one</i>!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />REUNITED.</h2>
<p>It was well-nigh daydawn, and Buenos Ayres trudged
wearily on, foot-sore and almost exhausted by his severe toil.
His mind was filled with doubt and fear.</p>
<p>He believed that he had more than covered the distance
mentioned by Tom Maxwell, as intervening between the corral
and the Main Trail, but yet he had not observed any trace
of it. Could it be possible that he had crossed the Trail, unknowingly?
He feared greatly that he had done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not do to turn back on an uncertainty,&rdquo; he muttered,
as he paused to glance around him once more. &ldquo;And
yet, a mistake, now, would be awful! If I only knew the
country better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then once more he pressed on, keeping as direct a
course as lay in his power. And as he gained the next ridge
he again paused, hoping from its summit to discover the desired
landmark.</p>
<p>But if he did not see what he sought, another object met
his gaze. One that caused his heart to leap to his very throat,
while his brain grew dizzy with a wild, delirious hope.</p>
<p>Upon a crest to his left, Ayres beheld a human form, that,
in the grim, gray light, was indistinct and phantom-like.
But still he believed that he could discern the flowing drapery
of a woman!</p>
<p>Ayres had learned a lesson by that night&rsquo;s events, and still
uncertain that the distant figure was not that of an enemy, he
sunk down into the tall grass, and then peered keenly toward
the spot where the vision had appeared. And, as he
awaited, he saw that it was approaching, and was indeed a
woman.</p>
<p>How his heart leaped, then! A woman&mdash;might it not be
his lost love, who had so strangely disappeared from their
midst?</p>
<p>And yet, how could it be? Clara had ridden away on her
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
horse; this woman was on foot, many miles from the spot
where he had last seen his friend.</p>
<p>Though the coming sun gilded the eastern horizon, the
swale in which the woman now was, still gloomy, and only
with the greatest difficulty could Ayres discern her shape at
all. But then she began ascending the hill, almost directly
toward him.</p>
<p>Trembling in every fiber of his being, the young man
awaited the result, fearful lest his new-born hope should be
dashed to the ground, after all. It did not seem possible that
this could be Clara.</p>
<p>But then a glad cry&mdash;a cry so full of joy and heartfelt exultation&mdash;broke
from his lips. The light fell full upon the
features of her who approached, and Ayres knew that he beheld
his lost love, Clara Calhoun!</p>
<p>She evidently heard the cry, for she paused and half-turned
as if to flee. Then he sprung up, calling aloud her name, as
he darted toward her trembling figure.</p>
<p>She stood as if petrified, then, with a glad cry, sunk to the
ground, laughing and weeping at the same time. Her overtasked
powers now seemed to give way before this unexpected
happiness, and she sunk into a deathlike swoon, as her
lover clasped her to his broad breast, covering her pale and
haggard face with passionate kisses.</p>
<p>For a moment Buenos acted like one demented, but then
as he found she did not return his caresses, a great fear assailed
him; he feared she was dead. And indeed, her looks
favored this supposition.</p>
<p>So pale and ghastly, lying against his heart like one utterly
devoid of life. But this great sorrow was spared the
young man.</p>
<p>Soon, beneath the fervid pressure of his lips, the color
and warmth came back to her face, and then her eyes
opened. The wild, hunted look quickly disappeared from
them, and with a low, glad cry her arms wound around his
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! you have found me, Buenos!&rdquo; she murmured,
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where have you been, darling? Why did you leave
us so strangely?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Whereupon Clara briefly detailed her adventures of the
past night, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw them all together, shouting and screaming, shooting
at each other, and it frightened me terribly. What could
these two men, though so brave, do against six great Indians?
I believed they must both be killed, and then as I thought
of how the savages would hunt for and find me, it seemed
as though I would go crazy! I would rather die than fall
into their hands, and yet I knew that they would capture me
if I should stay there until it was all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I turned and fled, not knowing whither I went, but
only thinking to escape from these dreadful savages. I ran
on until I fell from weakness, but then, as I fancied I could
hear them coming after me, I arose and kept on, only knowing
that I was running away from <i>them</i>. I did not know
where I was, nor whither I was going, and I believe that I
must have died had not you found me, dear Buenos,&rdquo; she added,
with a hysterical sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Clara&mdash;how you must have suffered!&rdquo; murmured
Ayres, pressing his lips to her brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have&mdash;more than words can tell. But I knew
you would come for me&mdash;I felt sure you would not leave me
to die here all alone. Poor father&mdash;how he must have suffered
from my thoughtlessness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! I forgot&mdash;and here I have lost over an hour!&rdquo;
exclaimed Buenos, springing to his feet in dismay at his remissness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what is it, Buenos?&rdquo; inquired Clara, in vague
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train&mdash;I was sent for help. The Indians, under
Dusky Dick, attacked it last night, and I fear my thoughtlessness
will be their ruin,&rdquo; agitatedly added Ayres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> was with those after me,&rdquo; shuddered Clara. &ldquo;But
help&mdash;where can you find it here? We are alone&mdash;God only
knows where!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a government train close behind us, when we
left the Main Trail, and I was searching for them, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He belonged to one&mdash;Captain Travers, I mean. It can
not be far away from here. Ah, if we can only find it!&rdquo; hastily
cried Clara.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know in what direction? Did you hear him say
where it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;or if I did, I forgot. I was so badly frightened, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must find it&mdash;I must. But you&mdash;my poor darling&mdash;you
are too tired to walk so far and fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I am strong now, since <i>you</i> have come. I can walk,
oh, so far; never fear. Besides, it is for father&mdash;and our
friends. And I could not stay here&mdash;I should die of fear.
<i>They</i> would catch me, I know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must try it. Remember that your father&rsquo;s life
may depend upon your own, Clara, and bear up if you can.
It will be hard&mdash;I wish I could spare you&mdash;but there is no
help for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was now quite high above the hills, for young
Ayres had lost a good hour by listening to Clara&rsquo;s story, and
now they pressed on at a fair pace, though ignorant whether
they were pursuing the right course or were going widely
astray.</p>
<p>But they were destined to meet with another interruption,
right speedily. They had just gained the next ridge when
Clara suddenly uttered a little cry of affright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Buenos&mdash;look there&mdash;the Indians! My God! we
are lost!&rdquo; she gasped, as, with outstretched hand, she guided
the gaze of her companion toward the ridge they had just left
but a few moments before.</p>
<p>One quick glance satisfied Buenos of the correctness of her
fears. He saw a little group of horsemen, that he believed
were mounted Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! stoop down Clara! They have not seen us yet,
and if we hide they may pass by without noticing our trail.
Follow me&mdash;quick!&rdquo; Ayres hissed, as, crouching low down, he
half-led, half-dragged his companion down the hill-side, making
toward a small clump of timber growing in the bottom of
the vale.</p>
<p>Toward this they ran at full speed, and had barely gained
its shelter when the horsemen reached the ridge they had just
left. A wild cry came to the ears of the fugitives, and then
they saw the horsemen dash furiously toward their refuge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep behind me, Clara,&rdquo; muttered Ayres, as he closely
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
examined the condition of his revolver. &ldquo;They will not find
us tame victims. They must pay a price for our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only two&mdash;perhaps they are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the other horses&mdash;four of them? They must have
riders, who are hiding behind their bodies. Look, they stop!
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no; don&rsquo;t shoot, Buenos,&rdquo; cried Clara, as she seized
the already-leveled revolver. &ldquo;See, they are friends&mdash;Captain
Travers and the Delaware, who saved me from the Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Clara?&rdquo; doubtfully replied Ayres; but then
a cry from one of the men settled this doubt, most agreeably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Calhoun, you know us; we are friends. Who is
that with you? If an enemy, we will rescue you from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara and Buenos stepped forth from the cover, and then
there ensued a warm greeting between the quartette, for even
the Delaware appeared overjoyed at beholding the pale-faced
squaw, once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buenos, tell this gentleman&mdash;I know he will help us,&rdquo;
eagerly uttered Clara, thinking first of her father&rsquo;s peril.</p>
<p>In a few brief words Ayres stated the position of affairs at
the emigrant train, as he had left it, and implored assistance.
The captain, though experiencing a momentary sensation something
akin to jealousy, at seeing how confidingly Clara clung
to the young man&mdash;was greatly excited, and promptly offered
his aid in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will. My old commander in danger! Good
Lord! how strange! Quick&mdash;help the lady to mount; there&rsquo;s
plenty of horses, fortunately. The camp is only about two
miles away, now. We&rsquo;ll get there almost before you know
it; and then for these red-skinned devils. No offense, I hope,
Delaware?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;me all white man, now. Cuss Injins all want, plenty
bad, you like&mdash;all but Delaware,&rdquo; grunted Tom.</p>
<p>Buenos quickly lifted Clara upon one of the horses, and
then, following suit, the quartette were speedily dashing over
the prairie, under the guidance of Delaware Tom, with the
two extra horses following closely in their wake.</p>
<p>The spirits of the two lovers rose with every long leap of
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
their mettlesome horses, though Buenos Ayres could not repress
certain misgivings as he thought on the length of time
that had transpired since he left the emigrant party. Could
they have held out through the long, fearful night?</p>
<p>He feared they could not have done so; something seemed
to tell him that the rescuing party would arrive only in time
to bestow upon his late comrades a Christian burial. And
beneath his breath he swore a deep and fearful vengeance,
should such indeed be the case.</p>
<p>They had ridden but a short distance, when Delaware
Tom uttered a low whoop, and pointed before them, though
he did not slacken his pace. Thus directed, the eyes of all
noted the presence of a small body of horsemen, just rising
the second ridge from them, who had evidently caught
sight of the quartette, at the same time, for they suddenly
drew rein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop&mdash;they&rsquo;re friends,&rdquo; cried Travers. &ldquo;I can tell
my boys as far as eye can reach. They&rsquo;re out after me, I
don&rsquo;t doubt; we stayed so much longer than expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At about the same time, the soldiers evidently made the
same discovery, for they gave their horses free rein and dashed
forward, with loud cheers. A smile rested upon the captain&rsquo;s
lips, at this. One could easily see that he was a beloved
leader, and proud of his boys in blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Morris,&rdquo; he said, as the leader of the dozen men
saluted, &ldquo;glad to see you. How&rsquo;s all at the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well, sir, but very anxious because you stayed out so
long. I made bold to take a few of the boys and ride out
to see if we could be of any use,&rdquo; respectfully replied the
sergeant, curiously eying the horses and the two extra riders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s work cut out for you, and hot work, too, if I
mistake not. But I know that <i>that</i> is no drawback,&rdquo; laughed
Travers, as the party again broke into a rapid gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it ain&rsquo;t, cap&rsquo;n. Injuns&mdash;if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They&rsquo;ve attacked the train this lady and gentleman
belong to&mdash;the one that passed us at Dutchman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes more the party had reached the camping-ground
of the government train, where now was all excitement,
for the news quickly spread, and was greeted with
loud, hearty cheers, for &rsquo;twas not every day that the boys got
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
a pleasure ride, and a brush with the Indians to wind up
with. The only fear they had, was that, as some must remain
behind to guard the train, they might be the unlucky
ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Travers, riding out a little from the rest,
&ldquo;how many of you wish to take a skurry after the Indians
this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With loud cheers, every man, soldiers, teamsters and all,
flocked forward, each striving to be foremost. A glad smile
played around their leader&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! though it&rsquo;s only what I expected from you. But
you can&rsquo;t all go. Sergeant Morris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick out thirty men, and see that they&rsquo;re ready in ten
minutes. Never mind rations; take only arms and plenty
of ammunition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Half the time&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Calhoun, if you will come with us, I will see
you more comfortably placed than on that horse. The sutler&rsquo;s
family is with us, and will see that you have all that you require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, captain, but it is needless; I am going to
my father, with the rest of you,&rdquo; firmly replied the maiden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think&mdash;how we must ride, to do any good, and then
there will probably be hard fighting at the end of it,&rdquo; he
urged, perplexedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought. Father is in trouble&mdash;perhaps dead or
badly wounded, and I not there! I <i>must</i> go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; said Buenos, riding to her side, &ldquo;listen to me.
You are nearly sick now, with what you have passed through.
Such a trial as this will be, would prove your death. You
would die before you got half-way. You must stay here&mdash;for
<i>my</i> sake, if not your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I will go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara, you <i>must</i> not. Don&rsquo;t oblige me to use compulsion,
but I know that you could never stand the ride. You must
stay. I will either come or send you word, as soon as it is
all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a hysterical sob, the maiden gave way, and allowed
the captain to lead her to the wagon set apart for the family
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
of the sutler. Leaving her in charge of the worthy wife, he
hastened back to the men, who were now in readiness.</p>
<p>From the description of the spot, as given by Ayres, Delaware
Tom declared that he knew it well, and could guide the
party directly there, as the crow flies. And then they set off
upon their mission, at a pace that satisfied even Ayres, urgent
as was his haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up, boys,&rdquo; shouted Travers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re riding for
life or death, now, and if your horses can&rsquo;t stand the pace,
follow on the best you can. You may be in at the death,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They numbered some thirty-five, all told, and not one felt
a doubt as to how the affair would turn out, <i>provided</i> the
emigrants were still holding out, when they arrived. But
Buenos had grave fears upon this point.</p>
<p>And still on they thundered, no longer in a compact body,
but strung out at short intervals, as the better or more speedy
horses took the front. At their head rode Ayres, Travers,
and Delaware Tom, the former mounted upon one of the captured
mustangs; a noble brute.</p>
<p>On until the head grew dizzy with the swift motion; until
the foam dropped from the horses&rsquo; lips and flecked their
counters; until their glossy coats were darkened with sweat,
together with the dust cast up by the trampling hoofs.</p>
<p>It was a wild, fearful ride, and the brains of the men seemed
intoxicated, so wildly did they whirl. Even their horses
seemed to catch the infection, for they thundered on as if mad,
snorting and fretting, with eyeballs wildly staring, fiery and
bloodshot.</p>
<p>Then Delaware Tom abruptly jerked his horse up, casting
him upon his haunches. A motion of his hand checked the
others.</p>
<p>Soaring to their ears, borne upon the light air, came the
confusedly-mingled sounds of rifle-shots, shrill yells and
hoarse shouts, from beyond the swell of the prairie. The
cause was but too evident.</p>
<p>The savages were desperately attacking the emigrant train.
Then all was not yet over&mdash;they might still be in time!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until all come up&mdash;then one steady charge, and
they&rsquo;re ours!&rdquo; whispered Travers to the impetuous Ayres.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />DOG EAT DOG.</h2>
<p>The old guide, Tom Maxwell, gave himself up for lost.
The fire blazed up brightly&mdash;the smoke blinded his eyes&mdash;the
heat began to scorch his garments. His fate seemed indubitably
sealed.</p>
<p>But such was not to be, just then. A sudden interruption
came, from an utterly unlooked-for source.</p>
<p>The quick clatter of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs was heard upon the
shingle that covered the base of the hill, and then a foam-flecked
steed dashed up beside the blazing fire. With a hoarse
cry, its rider sprung to the ground, and dashed through the
group of startled savages, hurling them rudely aside to clear
a passage.</p>
<p>Ere a hand could be raised to check him, the blazing fagots
were kicked aside and the daring man stood close to Maxwell.
One cut of the gleaming knife severed the rope that
bound him to the stake.</p>
<p>But then, with a howl, the Arapahoe chief, Wapashaw,
sprung forward, and hurled the man to the ground, ten feet
away.</p>
<p>All this passed so quickly that Maxwell was still blinking
to clear his eyes of smoke, unconscious that his bonds had
been partially cut, as his hands were still bound behind his
back.</p>
<p>The man sprung to his feet with a cry of defiance. And
then the features of Dusky Dick were revealed. Maxwell
stared at him in open-mouthed wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you do this, chief?&rdquo; uttered the White Snake,
in a voice low and even; but oh! what deadly ire that tone
contained! &ldquo;You know our agreement&mdash;this brave was to
be given me, unharmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare! Wapashaw is an Arapahoe chief. What is there
he can not dare? Who shall speak hot words in his ear?
Not the pale-faced coward&mdash;not the White Snake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;You should know whether I am a coward or not by this
time, chief. If you say I am, <i>I</i> say you <i>lie</i>. This brave is
<i>my</i> property&mdash;who dares do him harm until I speak the
word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i>, Wapashaw, the Arapahoe! <i>I</i> dare harm him! See! I
defy you&mdash;I kill him before your very eyes!&rdquo; yelled the savage,
now thoroughly angered, as he drew his tomahawk and
sprung toward the motionless form of the scout.</p>
<p>But like a meteor, the form of Dusky Dick glided forward,
and then his small fist alighted with crushing force full
between the eyes of the savage Hercules, hurling him to the
ground like a shot. Instantly all was the greatest confusion.</p>
<p>Several braves sprung toward the renegade, with flashing
weapons, but he met them boldly, with drawn revolvers.
Twice did there come a sharp report&mdash;twice did the death-yell
soar upward above the frightful din.</p>
<p>But then Wapashaw arose, and with a gesture motioned his
braves back. With a gesture that Dusky Dick well understood,
and was not slow to accept, he advanced to the wild
duel.</p>
<p>Casting his pistols aside, the renegade met his foe with
equal weapons. Knife slashed against knife, and the strife began
that could end only in death.</p>
<p>As Wapashaw sprung upon him, Maxwell had naturally
shrunk aside, and to his surprise he found that he was free,
save his hands. That was the first knowledge he had of the
timely act of Dusky Dick.</p>
<p>Then as the wild strife began, he made a desperate effort
to burst the cords that held his hands. Straining until he
thought all was in vain, the thongs suddenly parted with
a sharp twang.</p>
<p>Unnoticed in the confusion, he darted toward the crest of
the hill, that he knew overlooked the river. Down for nearly
a hundred feet, this abruptly fell.</p>
<p>It was truly a fearful leap, but the only chance for safety.
All other routes were cut off by the enemy.</p>
<p>Hesitating not a moment, Tom sprung boldly out over the
dizzy hight, and, shooting down like a stone, entered the water
with a sullen thud.</p>
<p>In another moment he was swimming rapidly down the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
stream, unharmed by the frightful descent, toward the corral,
unnoticed by all save those within the barricade. And this
he gained in safety, where he was warmly greeted by his
comrades, who had long since given him up as lost, beyond
a doubt.</p>
<p>Under less favorable circumstances, this feat would have
been impossible to execute successfully. But the attention
of all upon the hill was riveted upon the savage struggle between
their two leaders, Dusky Dick and Wapashaw, and
they did not give one thought to their captive, supposing him
to be firmly bound to the stake.</p>
<p>Then those who were left on guard over the wagon-train,
had been confused by the sudden extinguishing of the fire,
and the wild uproar that followed. Fearing their comrades
had been surprised by some foe, they one and all dashed at
full speed toward the spot, either not observing the leap of
Tom Maxwell, or else, in the dim light, believed it to be one
of the combatants.</p>
<p>Thus it was the old guide performed the seemingly impossible
feat without interruption.</p>
<p>In a short time the duel ended, but, from the corral, it
could not be seen which had been the victor, and then the
disappearance of the captive was first noticed. The confusion
was then really appalling.</p>
<p>Search was immediately made through the hills, the Indians
believing that he had fled in that direction, as none of
them coming from the plains had met him.</p>
<p>This search continued for a long time, when, after they
had abandoned it as useless, one brave noticed the dirt displaced
by the scout&rsquo;s feet in springing over the precipice.
That told the tale, and, fairly wild with anger, the Indians
rushed down and attacked the corral, fighting with a desperate
fury worthy a better cause.</p>
<p>But they were as bravely met. Rifle-shots answered arrow-flights,
until the strife became hand-to-hand. Over the barricades
swarmed the painted demons, until the interior was
filled with a confused mass of writhing, struggling humanity,
battling furiously, desperately.</p>
<p>But then came a glad sound to the ears of the overpowered
whites&mdash;the loud, hearty cheer, emanating from unmistakably
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
white men&rsquo;s throats. Then the thundering of many hoofs&mdash;the
sharp cracking of carbines and revolvers.</p>
<p>Fully as well did the Arapahoes recognize those shouts;
they had heard similar ones before, and they knew too well
the prowess of the boys in blue, to stand and wait their close
acquaintance.</p>
<p>There uprose the cry of retreat&mdash;and, like one man, the red-skins
tore themselves free from their antagonists, and fled, on
foot, on horseback, as fate favored them.</p>
<p>And among them the soldiers raged furiously, led by Travers,
Ayres and Delaware Tom. The latter fairly outdid
himself, and returned with girdle literally crowded with
scalps.</p>
<p>There is but little more to add.</p>
<p>That was a glad meeting between Buenos and Calhoun, especially
when the young man announced the safety of Clara.
He was truly the lion of the hour, but he bore his honors
with becoming meekness.</p>
<p>Then when the stragglers had all come in, the dead whites
were collected and afforded a Christian burial. It was a
melancholy sight, and not one dry eye&mdash;unless it might be those
of Delaware Tom, who was not remarkable for his sensitiveness&mdash;was
there in the encampment.</p>
<p>Taught a sad lesson by the recent events, Calhoun decided
to return to the Main Trail and remain under the protection
of his fellow-soldier&rsquo;s command until the rest of the road was
passed, and the two enjoyed many an hour, over their recollections.</p>
<p>Well, the train got safely to its destination, without any
more serious accidents, and, in due time, Clara Calhoun was
made Mrs. Buenos Ayres; and Tom Maxwell was at the wedding,
and danced with &ldquo;pritty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dusky Dick was supposed to have been killed during
his duel with Wapashaw, for he was never heard of afterward.</p>
<p>And thus we leave them.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
